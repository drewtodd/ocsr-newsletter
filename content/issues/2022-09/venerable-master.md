As you read this I hope you are  looking back on a relaxing Labor Day weekend. All of us are  free to associate with groups of our choice, and I choose to be a Scottish Rite Mason.  We must hold our freedoms dearly and exercise them when we can.  

In order to eke out a basic living, Americans in the 1800’s had to work an average of  12 hours a day, 7 days a week. They faced unsafe working conditions, insufficient access to fresh air, a lack of sanitary facilities and breaks for rest.  Workers expressed their dissatisfaction with  these conditions and joined groups to push for change.  The country was  finally convinced changes needed to be made and as a result, a  law was signed by President Grover Cleveland on June 28, 1894, officially   establishing  Labor Day as the  day we celebrate the American Worker.  While  some people think this holiday marks the end of summer, it really celebrates the contributions of the American worker.

Freedom of expression, both verbal and nonverbal behaviors that express a person’s opinions, point of view, or identity, is considered by many countries to be a fundamental right.  Freedom of speech is essential to freedom of expression or freedom of thought and is vital to our democratic self rule.  Many people today lack these basic freedoms and must accept government censorship and the control of their thoughts.  Americans would consider this to be a very unacceptable alternative.  

For me the simplest way to express my freedom is to vote.  I enjoy the freedom to formulate my own opinions and express this freedom by casting my vote for the candidates that share my way of thinking.  Please enjoy your freedom.

Fraternally,
