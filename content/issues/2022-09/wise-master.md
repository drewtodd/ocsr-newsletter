Greetings Brethren,

It’s back to school season for those with children and I hope an end to this nasty bear market in equities. Oil has receded, home prices have moderated, the dollar has strengthened (albeit rushing into more Fed tightening), Bitcoin continues its ‘tick tock next block’ thing and quite frankly, the heat is doing damage to my electricity bill. On the other hand, our Scottish Rite Valley continues to rebound out of the pandemic (oh right, there is still a global virus interrupting families and supply chains). It was nice to have dinner with the brethren and welcome our new members with Caps-N-Rings last month. 

During the final quarter of the year, I’ll read about and share musings on the final degree of the Chapter. I'm excited! We recall that in the 15th degree, an intimate conversation between Zerubbabel and King Cyrus essentially frees the Judean people with Truth being the ultimate victor. The 16th degree builds upon the lessons taught in the 15th with a particular emphasis on the virtues of faithfulness and wisdom as exemplified on the belief that God aids those who pursue a good work. The 17th degree condemns King Herod for murdering John the Baptist with Truth (depending on your perspective) being the ultimate loser. We are reminded of the Book of Revelation (authored by St. John) which paints a somber picture of future if society abandons the virtues and the One. Truth. God. [typos are mine]

Be happy Brethren for we are here and this is now. “Quality! That is what the Sophists taught. Not ethical relativism. Not pristine virtue. But excellence. Before the church of reason. Before substance. Before form. Before mind and matter. Before dialectic itself. Quality had been absolute and the medium chosen was rhetoric. Some say the good is found in happiness but how is happiness defined? Happiness and good are not objective thus we cannot deal with them scientifically. They exist in the mind. So if you want to be happy just change your mind. Haha, haha.” (Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance, Pirsig).

In our calls to the Almoner, remember Brethren: He who giveth to charity, lendeth to the Lord.

Sincerely & Fraternally,
