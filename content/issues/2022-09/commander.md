SPope John Paul II once said that "Freedom consists not in doing what we like, but in having the right to do what we ought."

With that inspirational quote in mind, I happily offer you all the gift of freedom - the freedom to volunteer for the upcoming Super Breakfast on Sunday, September 18th, 2022.  

As many of you know, this one event is our big annual fundraiser for the Valley - not for the CLC, not for Masons for Mitts, not for Raise a Reader.  **The funds we raise as a result of this single annual event go to support our Valley directly - rent, insurance, operating expenses... the lifeblood of the Orange County Scottish Rite.**

Not free to attend?  You can help in other ways - you can donate, you can sell some tickets, you can spread the word about the event.  

A few details about the event:

**When:** Sunday, September 18th. 2022 9am-12 noon
**Where:** 626 W. Lincoln Ave., Anaheim, CA 92806 (cross streets are Harbor Blvd & Lincoln Ave)
**Cost:** $12/adult, $6/child (10 years old or younger)
**Menu:** custom omelets, waffles, bacon, biscuits & gravy, home-fried potatoes, juices, & coffee.

Interested in volunteering?  Please reach out to me via email - [todd@quantimark.com](mailto:todd@quantimark.com) - or cell [650-863-4767](tel:6508634767) and together we'll work to ensure that our Valley has the financial freedom to pay our bills without using our investments.

For those of you with a competitive streak... as we've not had our Super Breakfast for the past few years, there should be some pent up demand... here's your chance to participate in what could be our largest fundraiser to date.  Our GenSec's event currently holds the record... I'm hoping that we can surpass his numbers this year.  

I'd like to close with a final freedom quote:  "A hero is someone who understands the responsibility that comes with his freedom." - Bob Dylan
