Brethren: Fall will arrive this month and our Valley is busy. On September 18th (Sunday), we will be having our first Super Breakfast fundraiser in over 2 years. This is the only fundraising event we hold where the proceeds go directly to our Valley. Copious amounts of waffles, bacon, sausages and custom omelets will be available. Please make a point of attending this enjoyable event. Tickets are in the mail. 

We will be holding our Stated Meeting at 6:30 pm at the DeMolay Center on Monday, September 12th. Once again, we will be serving a tasty dinner following our meeting. If you haven't attended an OCSR meeting for some time, now is an excellent time to return. 

The Scottish Rite Research Society will be holding their 2022 Symposium at the Oakland Scottish Rite Temple on September 17, 2022. Among the distinguished Masonic Scholars speaking at this event are Ill. Arturo de Hoyos, 33° GC and Honorable Adam Kendall, 32° KCCH. The cost is $15 per person and they are offering a Zoom option for attendance. Please contact the Valley office for information on how to register. 

Finally, please contact the office if you have any questions regarding your dues status. Our Fall Reunion is coming up in November. Please tell your Blue Lodge Brothers about our Valley. Petitions are available on our Valley website. Have an outstanding month.

Fraternally,
