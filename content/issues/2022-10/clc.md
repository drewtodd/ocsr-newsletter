Welcome back to the RiteCare Childhood Language Center or Orange County!  Fall is definitely in the air and once again we are back at work helping children become great communicators!

Let's give a warm CLC welcome to our new Clinic Director, Leslie Walker, whose presence has already provided the clinic with strong leadership and effective organization. Our new Chapman interns have already dived  into  the routine of providing their clients with challenging creative and focused lessons. We are now open 4 days a week, so although we are not yet full, we are doing evaluations every week and constantly adding to the schedule.

This month’s theme  is fall leaves and apples. Our festive  fall tree in the waiting room is  slowly  being filled with student work.

Lyla has been  coming to the Center after school to work on her speech sounds. She rises to the challenge while working with Miss Jessica who has been challenging  her with  new vocabulary and more difficult words  to say during her  favorite game of Candyland.

Queenie’s language blossomed over the summer and she’s now not only adding to her vocabulary, but also practicing her speech sounds. Miss Julie is motivating her with dot paints.

Thank you for all your help and support!
