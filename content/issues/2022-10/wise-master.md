Greeting Brethren,

The last few months have been particularly hard; faith, family, friends, feelings, finances are all being scrutinized. Over the last ten weeks or so it has felt like I’ve been rolling concurrent snake eyes and boxcars when all I need is a mean reversion six, seven, or eight to hit the come bar or at the very worst, crap out to clear the board. The probabilities seem out of whack. What is happening lately? You can image my relief when I learned that there are currently six planets in retrograde. While Mercury does enough damage on our collective psyches alone, I’m now comforted learning that Uranus, Jupiter, Neptune, Saturn and even the Pluto have contributed to our celestial chaos and more importantly, gives me reason to blame my bout of unluckiness. I personally find solace in answers despite not having any real beliefs in the astrology of our seemingly potent planetary backspins which during this time introspection is recommended.

The final quarter of the year moonwalks us into the 18th Degree or Knight Rose Croix, the capstone of the Chapter and an exceptionally beautiful, philosophical, and practical experiences in all of Freemasonry. We can summarize the lesson in three words which Masons will find familiar: Faith, Hope, and Charity. The Knights Rose Croix Heredom are bound to give charity to the poor, attend to the sick, and encourages earnest thought and introspection. Even more exciting, we are given the True Word, learn the solution to the question of opposites, and to my personal favorite, the great secrets of Alchemy are unfolded unto us. An esoteric meaning is entrusted to us by declaring that Nature and Reason united demonstrates the infinity of God and his divine essence implanted in man. Finally, that we derive our strength through the practice of Charity.

> Faith + Hope + Charity is especially meaningful to our mission statement

Faith + Hope + Charity is especially meaningful to our mission statement which my wife and I loosely describe as having faith in positive outcomes, hope for new beginnings and a service that extends beyond bounds. During times of improbabilities, roadblocks, and seasonal frustrations we are often motivated by these subtle yet powerful reminders to remain steadfast in our works. Thankfully, the final retrograde ends on January 22nd which conveniently coincides with the end of our Scottish Rite terms in office. Buckle up my brethren and keep building until then!

In our calls to the Almoner, remember Brethren: He who giveth to charity, lendeth to the Lord.

Sincerely & Fraternally,
