In the 24th degree “Prince of Tabernacle” a powerful question is asked to us for reflection. The question was: “Is the doctrine of the immortality of the soul consoling to you or a source of menace and despair or merely a superstition?” Is death an accomplishment? Is death something you fear? Is death something you can’t imagine? Is death a person or figure? Do you think you’ll never die? Is Death but a new beginning? Is Death actually the way we go back to where we came from? 

> Is the doctrine of the immortality of the soul consoling to you or a source of menace and despair or merely a superstition?

All of these questions have came across our minds at some point or another. So we are taught in the 23rd and 24th degree the importance of living righteously, having faith in the one god, and being rightly initiated in the different levels of the “mysteries”. The different levels or degrees of initiation into the mysteries are supposed to be presented to you when you are ready to receive more light. The “lesser mysteries” were received by all as an understanding of primitive religion and morality which were a lot easier to understand. But the “greater mysteries” were received by those who had dedicated their time and actually lived by those duties. The “ancient mysteries” utilized symbols and allegories treating that mysterious topic of immortality and death more mysteriously. Those degrees might have been more spiritually inclined with elements of nature.

These mysteries exhibited “The One” of which nature is an infinite illustration containing a moral lesson created to guide the soul through life and cheer it in death. The Grecian mysteries and Masonry teach you how to obtain the knowledge of “Devine Law” by practicing virtue, thus imitating the perfection of God. Those virtues were Silence, Temperance, Fortitude, Temperance and Justice. These virtues would prepare your soul for immortality by your actions, which is the necessity of personal holiness of man for admission into the “Society of Gods”. We should not forget the constant struggle though in EVERY man’s nature between divine will implanted by God and the natural will caused by the frailty of the flesh, because it is on going with all the universe. This struggle is the law of harmony in action reconciling and bringing into accord the spiritual and material nature of men. Continue your pursuit in living a more righteous, and spiritual life so that the memory or energy of you is felt for generations to come! 

Will your Death result in a reincarnation or will it be an initiative process into the divine realms?

Fraternally,
