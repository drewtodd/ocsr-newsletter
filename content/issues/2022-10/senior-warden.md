## Memento Mori
Greetings, brothers. Welcome to the dark month of October; where the air turns cooler, the year groans into its inevitable dotage, and we traditionally cap things with a macabre celebration of death in All Hallows Eve. Seems like a good one to theme around the subject of one's mortality.

It may seem negative to dwell on death in a monthly newsletter, but we're Masons! It's what we do! One of the things, anyway.

So many learned people have advised on the subject. Mark Twain said, "I do not fear death. I had been dead for billions and billions of years before I was born and had not suffured the slightest inconvenience from it." Ernest Hemmingway wrote that "all stories, if continued far enough, end in death."

Death is part of the process. What lies therein we cannot see, but how bad must it be if all who are born are destined for it? 

> “Stop whatever you’re doing for a moment and ask yourself: Am I afraid of death because I won’t be able to do this anymore?” —Marcus Aurelius

Our fascination and obsession with avoiding death is both comical and unfortunate. We spend billions of dollars and hours searching for the keys to unending life, trying to cheat death. To what end?

Death is part of the process. It is necessary. Embrace it.

Instead of trying to eliminate death, I humbly suggest we put that time and energy into making the most of the life we have: Taking care of ourselves, sure. Hurtling ourselves towards a premature and unnecessary death would cheat us of the opportunity to truly experience life. And that's where our energies should be focused.

Let death remind us of the limited time we have in life and encourage us to make the most of it.

Until next time, be well, brothers.
