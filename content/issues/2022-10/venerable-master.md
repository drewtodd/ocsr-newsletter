## Death

> “What we have done for ourselves alone dies with us; what we have done for others and the world remains and is immortal.”  Albert Pike

Our final day will come at some point for all of us but hopefully not too soon or at least  not until we are ready…

On a personal note, my mom passed away last December, and I have been working with my siblings on settling her estate.  Even though she had made detailed arrangements for the end of her life,  it still has been a difficult task for us to wrap up all the unplanned items.  So, I am forever grateful to mom for organizing all her finances into a trust.  When my dad died, the task of organizing all of their combined  possessions, acquired from over 40 years of an active  family life, fell upon my mom.   Thankfully, she hired a good lawyer to help her take on the task, which was made even more difficult  because some property was only in my dad’s name.

Now it is my turn to make plans with my wife for when my time comes to an end. As things stand now, not attending to the task of organizing the disposition of personal finances and property, (that took a lifetime to establish),  before  my unanticipated death would  only  leave a big mess for my family, who would already be suffering from the pain of my untimely passing.

LegalZoom states there are four types of wills, as well as Living  trusts that can be created  to help people who want to protect their estate upon their passing.  As I begin to plan for my own family’s security after my death, I can see there is a lot of reading ahead of me before I can decide on the best way to proceed. While it may be uncomfortable to think about planning for the end, we must do this work to help us  make the best decisions to secure our family’s security  and peace of mind after we are gone.

If you have someone who helped you through end of life planning  or who has any  tips on how to navigate through establishing a living trust or creating a will,  please share. By working together and sharing, we can help and support each other through this challenging, but very essential, process.
