Greetings from the West!

We had a most excellent classroom lecture series this past Saturday, May 13th with 9 total in attendance. We covered a ton of material from a brief comparison/contrast between the York and Scottish Rites, the Mysticism of the Lodge of Perfection, Introduction to Rosicrucianism, Comparative Philosophies of the Mystery Schools of the Council, a deep dive into the 25th Degree's symbolism, a Perennial view of the Journey of Scottish Rite Degrees, and an analysis of the 32nd Degree (simplified).

We welcomed 5 new students to our Master Craftsman "Society" and are excited to announce Bro. Lucas Kastner, 32° as our newest addition to the team of classroom lecturers.

Our next Classroom segment will be held on Saturday, November 4th, from 8am-5pm at the DeMolay Center and is conducted in conference format (Speakers, Q&As, snacks, drinks/coffee, and lunch provided).

I'd like to personally thank Bros. Robert Schmidt 32°, Lucas Kastner 32°, Chris De Dios 32°, and the May 13th attendees (32°s) for your commitment to excellence.

_* If any Brothers have questions on Freemasonry (F&AM / AF&AM), Scottish Rite, appendant bodies, or other esoteric orders, and would like us to conduct a deep dive lecture (on those or any other related topics) for Saturday, November 4th, please contact me by October 2023 stated meeting._
