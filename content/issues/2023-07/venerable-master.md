## Welcome New Brothers!

I'm very happy to welcome our new brothers to the Valley. June saw us running a special Reunion Class in Long Beach so that we could get them onboarded as quickly as possible. When you attend our Stated Meeting in July, please be sure to say hello and welcome our brothers:

- MarcAntonia Murillo, 32° 
- Brandon O'Brien, 32°
- Joshua Price, 32°

## New "Valley Talks" Series Starts in July

After the July Stated Meeting we'll be starting a new series to complement our Distinguished Speaker event: Valley Talks.

These are opportunities for members of the Valley to give an informal talk on a topic that they think will be of interest to the brethren. I'm pleased to say that, in addition to our innagural speech (which I'll be giving), we've already got a few more lined up.

**Brothers: I encourage -- nay, CHALLENGE -- you all to consider contributing to this series!** What kind of "college of Freemasonry" would we be without enlightened discussion, discovery, and education? Let's take our Stated Meeting dinners to the next level and bring on the scholarly discussion!

*Note: In most cases, all are invited, Scottish Rite member or not. That includes wives, family, and friends. If you want to give a Valley Talk on a strictly Masonic topic that requires a tiled environment, please let me know and we can make the appropriate arrangements.*

As mentioned, I'll be giving the first of these talks on Monday evening, July 10th, at 7:00pm, immediately following Stated Meeting. Please join me for a delicious meal and an enlivening discussion: **Exploring Stoicism**. As a companion to the article series I've been contributing all year long, I'll be looking at this ancient philosophy and exploring it's history, how it aligns with Masonic thought, and how it can be applied to the hectic world we live in today. I hope to see you there.

And with that said, let's continue our monthly exploration of the Stoic school of philosophy...

## Unpacking the Value of Philosophy: From Ancient Wisdom to Modern Insights
Greetings brothers. Welcome back to our continuing exploration of the philosophy of Stoicism.  Before we dive headlong into what it actually means to practice Stoicism, it’s essential that we first establish a firm footing in the broader landscape. After all, Stoicism doesn’t exist in isolation; it’s just one branch of a tree, a tree that has its roots in philosophy itself.

So what is philosophy, and why should we invest our time understanding it?

### Dispelling Misconceptions
Let's start by dusting off some widely held misconceptions. Philosophy is not an abstract discipline meant only for musty academic halls; rather, it's a practical tool that provides a guide for life. And Stoics? They're not people void of emotion. Despite the common usage of "stoic" as an adjective to describe an unfeeling person, Stoicism as a philosophy is far more nuanced and rich, advocating for clear-headed rationality and virtue.

### So What Is Philosophy?
{{< figure src="img/IMG_1019.png" class="right medium border shadow rotate-clockwise" alt="The Greek symbol Phi" >}}

Philosophy, derived from the Greek term for "love of wisdom," is a life compass. It's humanity's unending quest to make sense of our world, our reality, and our very nature. Philosophy, like a reliable anchor, provides stability amidst the rough seas of life's uncertainties.

#### Philosophy and Religion: A Constructive Comparison
At this point you may be thinking, isn’t that what religion is for? While religion also aims to provide a life framework, philosophy walks a different path. Rather than relying on supernatural beliefs, philosophy uses reason as its guiding light to comprehend our world and our place within it. Philosophy encourages questioning and exploration, fostering a culture of critical thinking and open dialogue, free from dogma. It doesn't set rules in stone, but presents adaptable truths refined through evidence and reasoned discussion.

### The Critique of Philosophy: Pros and Cons
As we dig into philosophy, it is only fair to also mention some of the criticisms often levied against it. While philosophy can provide a robust framework for life and understanding, it isn't without its detractors.

1. **Impracticality**: One common critique is that philosophy can be too abstract or theoretical, resulting in discussions that, while intellectually stimulating, seem to offer little in terms of practical solutions to real-world problems (Fear not, brave reader! We’ll begin addressing this issue next month.)

2. **Lack of empirical evidence**: Unlike the sciences, philosophy does not depend on empirical evidence. The absence of a testable or verifiable basis for its conclusions is a point of contention for those who place a premium on empirical knowledge.

3. **Inaccessibility**: Another critique often leveled against philosophy is that it can be dense and difficult to understand, making it appear inaccessible or elitist, thereby reducing its societal impact.

4. **Subjectivity**: The subjective nature of philosophy — where personal interpretations abound and definitive answers are rare — leads some critics to question its ability to produce reliable, consistent knowledge.

5. **Inconclusiveness**: Given that the same philosophical questions have been debated for centuries without clear agreement, some critics argue that philosophy can be seen as an unending cycle of debates with little tangible progress.

However, it's important to remember that these criticisms do not negate the value of philosophy. Like any field of study, philosophy has its challenges, but it also offers unique perspectives and tools for understanding our world and our place within it. The ability to grapple with criticism, paradoxically, forms an integral part of philosophical inquiry itself.

#### Modern Philosophers: Not Just Ancient History

Another criticism of philosophy is: It’s so old! Why does our so-called framework for life come from guys who lived thousands of years ago, and how can it possibly apply to our modern lives?

While our journey into philosophy often begins with the ancient Greeks or Romans, it's important  to remember that philosophical inquiry is far from being confined to the past. Even today, individuals are pushing the boundaries of philosophical thought, and not all of them are ensconced within the ivy walls of academia. A couple of modern examples include Daniel Dennett and Carl Sagan. 

#### Daniel Dennett

{{< figure src="img/straylight2551_A_smiling_Daniel_Dennett_walking_in_Central_Park_eb0b6455-6a07-434e-939b-3285081b0584.png" class="full border shadow" alt="A_smiling_Daniel_Dennett_walking_in_Central_Park" caption="&quot;The secret of happiness is: Find something more important than you are and dedicate your life to it.&quot;<br> - Daniel Dennett" >}}

Daniel Dennett, a contemporary philosopher, continues to significantly contribute to the philosophy of mind, science, and biology. His work wrestles with questions about consciousness and free will, topics as ancient as philosophy itself, yet his approach is distinctly modern, interfacing with fields like cognitive science and evolutionary biology. His books, such as "Consciousness Explained" and "Elbow Room: The Varieties of Free Will Worth Wanting," stand as testaments to the vibrancy and relevance of philosophical discourse today.

#### Carl Sagan
{{< figure src="img/straylight2551_Carl_Sagan_sitting_in_a_comfy_leather_armchair_a_5e9b4db1-aa7e-4aba-9a78-c0faa39b3be5.png" class="full border shadow" caption="&quot;We are a way for the cosmos to know itself.&quot; - Carl Sagan" >}}

Carl Sagan, perhaps a less conventional example, was known predominantly as an astrophysicist and science communicator. However, his impact on the philosophy of science is undeniable. Sagan delved into philosophical thought throughout his career, championing skepticism and critical thinking. His reflections on humanity's place in the cosmos, as seen in his work "Pale Blue Dot," invite us to grapple with humbling philosophical questions about our insignificance within the vast universe. While Sagan might not have been a philosopher in the traditional sense, his work demonstrates that philosophical thinking can emerge in unexpected places.

These fellows show that philosophy is not just a relic from the past; it is an ongoing dialogue that evolves with our changing understanding of the world. Philosophy remains relevant, serving as an essential tool to navigate our modern world, interpret scientific findings, and address ethical dilemmas of our times. It is not solely the purview of ancient scholars but is a vibrant, living field continually nourished by curious minds.

### Philosophy Hides In Plain Sight

If you look for it, you can find serious philosophical thought in all kinds of unexpected places. Think about the work of the comedian **George Carlin**, the author **Kurt Vonnegut**, or the **Wachowski siblings**; creators of _The Matrix_ series of films. 

### Comparing Philosophical Perspectives: Hedonism vs. Eudaimonia

***Hedonism** (n) [HEE-duh-niz-uhm]: The ethical theory that pleasure is the highest good and proper aim of human life.*

***Eudaimonia** (n) [yoo-dai-MOH-nee-uh]: A state of being where one is fully actualized, achieving their highest potential, and living in accordance with the natural world and its laws.; often translated as "flourishing" or "the good life".*

As we delve into what different philosophical paths might resemble, let's go back to the past and examine two contemporary schools of thought from Ancient Greece — Epicureanism, a paradigm of *hedonic philosophy*, and Stoicism, an advocate for *eudaimonic philosophy*. These schools arose at the same time in history and  offer us insights into how distinct philosophical perspectives can shape our understanding of life and happiness.

#### The Epicureans

{{< figure src="img/straylight2551_Epicurus_smiling_content_in_Ancient_Greece_garde_c1facb7c-b24b-4f23-9db2-a8f31da5e5af.png" class="full border shadow" >}}

Epicureans were proponents of the notion that life's ultimate purpose is the pursuit of pleasure. But they weren’t a bunch of debaucherous hedonists, as the term is often interpreted today. Far from it. Epicureans advocated for a measured approach to pleasure. They discerned between types of pleasure, arguing that refined, intellectual pleasures were superior to basic, physical ones. Moreover, they championed the concept of *ataraxia*, a state of serene tranquility achieved by avoiding unnecessary desires and fears. To them, the highest pleasure was, in essence, peace of mind. To sum it up in the words of the philosopher Epicurus, "Not what we have, but what we enjoy, constitutes our abundance."

> "Not what we have, but what we enjoy, constitutes our abundance." - Epicurus

#### The Stoics

{{< figure src="img/straylight2551_Seneca_the_philosopher_sitting_outdoors_on_Roman_b0692b6b-95c5-4685-9c35-a5bc6d644d4d.png" class="full border shadow" >}}

Contrastingly, the Stoics presented a different roadmap for a well-lived life. Rather than seeking pleasure, Stoics placed virtue and wisdom on the pedestal, asserting that these were the true keys to *eudaimonia*, or flourishing. To them, eudaimonia wasn't a fleeting moment of happiness or a surge of pleasure, but a lasting state of being, characterized by inner peace, resilience, and satisfaction, achieved through living a virtuous life. 

Central to Stoicism is the concept of *arete*, a Greek term that translates as 'excellence' or 'virtue'. It signifies the highest potential of the human soul, a kind of moral excellence one can strive for. Stoicism encouraged individuals to focus on improving their moral and intellectual character, to act justly, and to accept what they cannot change. The Stoic philosopher Seneca encapsulated this beautifully: "It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that things are difficult."

> "It is not because things are difficult that we do not dare; it is because we do not dare that things are difficult." - Seneca

These two schools, while offering different paths, underscore that philosophy isn't merely an abstract exercise but a practical guide for life. They invite us to ponder the kind of life we wish to lead and the values we want to uphold, questions that remain as relevant today as they were in Ancient Greece.

### Up Next: Stoicism In Practice
In this installment, we've dispelled misconceptions about philosophy, examined its function and role, and contrasted it with religion. We've also briefly visited the schools of Epicureanism and Stoicism, setting the stage for deeper exploration. 

Join us next month as we plunge deeper into Stoic practices and how to weave them into the fabric of our daily lives. Until then, brothers, be well.
