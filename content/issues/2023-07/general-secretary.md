Brethren: June was an active month for our Valley. On June 9th & 10th, we had 3 Orange County Scottish Rite candidates go through a Reunion at the Valley of Long Beach. All went well and 5 active OCSR Brothers attended to support our newest members. We welcome MarcAntonio Murillo 32°, Brandon O'Brien 32° and Joshua Price 32° as our newest Masters of the Royal Secret. We thank the Valley of Long Beach for their hospitality. OCSR has a Fall Reunion coming up on October 6th & 7th. Please submit any petitions for worthy Master Masons who have a desire for further light in Masonry. Our Master Craftsman programs, participation in ritual and Valley events and our support of our Childhood Language Center are all major reasons to join.

Our July Stated Meeting will be held at 6:30 pm on July 10th (not July 3rd due to the holiday). Attendance at our Stated Meetings is up and the meals are very good. We thank Brother Larry Griffin 32° and his wife for all of their hard work on setting up the good meals. With America's Independence Day being celebrated this month, it is a good time to reflect on our fraternity. Freemasonry eschews any particular, contemporary causes while encouraging independent thought and actions.  Freemasonry in our country predates independence and our Brothers played prominent roles in the formation of the United States. 

Dues notices for 2023 will be arriving late this month and in August. Dues payments can be mailed in or paid online through a link on our OCSR website (ocscottishrite.org). If you have any questions about your dues status, please contact the office. Have a great 4th of July.

Fraternally,
