Welcome back to the RiteCare Childhood Language Center of Orange County!  The last day of our fall semester was a busy one that was full of smiles and laughter.  Children and their student clinicians celebrated the upcoming holidays by engaging in activities such as making ornaments, creating snowmen with cotton balls, and reading both winter and holiday themed books.  Many of the children were excited to talk about their holiday plans and parents expressed gratitude for the student clinicians and for the services that are provided by the RiteCare Childhood Language Center.

Our Secret Santa once again remembered the children.  Their smiles and joy were contagious, and they were all excited to play with their gifts.  Many of the children enjoyed their time so much that they did not want to leave the clinic!  This is a truly a testament to the clinicians' efforts throughout the season.  The student clinicians and supervisors are thankful for the opportunity to work with the children and the families that we serve each week.  


Sincerely,
