Greetings Brethren,

We had a busy year and I look forward to the renewal a new year sets forth as we progress our officer line by welcoming a new set of leaders into our ranks. I hope it goes without saying that I appreciate the support of our Scottish Rite brethren and that it was truly fun to serve the Valley. The world is slowly opening from the lingering effects of C19 and I would look to no better place nor time to focus your energies than our philanthropic endeavors. Get involved (and to those of us leaving office, perhaps I’ll add: Stay involved).

Personally, I reflect on 2022 with a few scars in mind, undoubted progress and, lots of laughs. We added a third child to our family and lost lots of sleep. I achieved my goal of reading more than 12 books (mostly on the topic of Bitcoin which is my new favorite subject) and we refreshed our family’s mission statement: We believe in fun, family and faith. Faith in positive outcomes, prioritizing family, and an abundance of fun along the way. We perform this activity every year because we hope that by reminding ourselves of these declared values, we can lean on them during challenging times for comfort and support.

Freemasonry offers us this most incredible quaternity of temperaments, kept in proper balance. I cannot understate this point enough which is the testament of the ancients. To literally get four generations to come together and agree yields infinite rewards (harmony being the strength & support of all societies…) and extends beyond the grave. Tacitus said it beautifully, “It may well be there is a cycle in human affairs and morals alternate as do the seasons. Ancient times were not always better. Our generations too produced many examples of honorable behavior for posterity to copy. One must hope this praiseworthy competition long endures.” …standing on the shoulders of giants as Brother Newton said. Vires in Numeris!

Best of luck to the officers elect on their leadership into 2023.

In our calls to the Almoner, remember Brethren: He who giveth to charity, lendeth to the Lord.

Sincerely & Fraternally,

Brandon Cook
