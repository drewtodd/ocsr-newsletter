Can you believe it?  It seems like just a few short weeks ago that it was January 2022, and now here we are at the start of 2023.  

With the start of a new year comes a clean slate - a blank book with 365 fresh, new pages before us.  How will we fill those pages?  Will we fill them with complaints against the evils in the world? Or with lists of the good deeds we accomplish?  With scribbled haikus of how life is unfair? Or epic poems of how we were able to help our brethren?

We are, each one of us, the authors of our own life... but that doesn't mean that we can't be inspired by the authors around us.  Is there a certain Nazarene who lived in a way you admire?  I think there'd be some turning of the other cheek if you're a copy-cat.  Inspired by Buddha?  I don't think he'd mind if we all plagiarized him a bit in our lives.  Have a personal hero?  Emulate them if you feel inspired.

Here are a few copyrights I plan to infringe upon in the new year:

> “To enlarge the sphere of social happiness is worthy of the benevolent design of a Masonic institution; and it is most fervently to be wished, that the conduct of every member of the fraternity, as well as those publications, that discover the principles which actuate them, may tend to convince mankind that the grand object of Masonry is to promote the happiness of the human race." - George Washington


> "Masonic labor is purely a labor of love. He who seeks to draw Masonic wages in gold and silver will be disappointed. The wages of a Mason are in the dealings with one another, sympathy begets sympathy, kindness begets kindness, helpfulness begets helpfulness, and these are the wages of a Mason." - Benjamin Franklin 

Fraternally,
