A very Happy New Year to all of the Brothers of our Valley. The Valley office was busy in the last few months with membership dues payments. We thank all of the Brothers for your prompt payments. Your membership dues provide the Valley with most of our working capital for the year. 

The first Stated Meeting of the year will be at 6:30 pm on Monday, January 9th at the DeMolay Center. Please start off your year by supporting our Valley by your participation with attendance. A dinner will be served following the meeting. On Sunday, January 15th, we will be holding our annual Installation of new officers at the DeMolay Center. Installation is a most enjoyable ceremony and is open to family and friends. Let's give our new line of officers a great start to the year. Our Spring Reunion will be held on April 21st and 22nd at the DeMolay Center. As we weren't able to hold a Fall Reunion, this will be our first opportunity to initiate new members in one year. Please make a point of talking to your newer Blue Lodge Master Masons about OCSR. Many Brothers are looking for deeper study in to the 3 Craft degrees and the Scottish Rite Master Craftsman Program provides advanced Masonic scholarship. 

Lastly, let's all work together to make 2023 the best year ever for the Orange County Valley.

Fraternally,
