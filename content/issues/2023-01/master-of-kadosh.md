Greetings everyone,

What a year it’s been! Our first year back fraternally! It was great seeing the support in the valley by the brethren who stayed disciplined and showed up to all our stated meetings. Also,  the heads of body who dedicated their efforts in producing monthly newsletters, organizing committee, and staying on coarse throughout the year with our events! Without the fraternal meets there’s no progress so let’s continue showing up and staying motivated. Without the new members we can’t show anyone how the work is done or why it’s important. 

Serving as a head of body is crucial! Every new member should strive to participate so that they become better men and learn more about themselves. Understanding fraternal organization, policy, leadership, team communication, dependability, and accounting are skills gained when given the responsibility or privilege to take on a role in Scottish Rite. 

I encourage new members to participate and learn the history of that chair which they occupy. There’s many ways to fulfill those positions and many things to learn about the importance of your seat. Meet those expectations and add a taste of your own leadership to our valley! 

Thank you all for the opportunity to let me serve as Master of Kadosh for the Consistory in 2022! I had a great time and experience! To New beginnings and important roles we climb! Wish you all the best in 2023! 


Fraternally,
