Dear Brethren,

On behalf of the Orange County Scottish Rite Valley, it is my pleasure to welcome you to a New Year, hoping that 2023 keeps the promise for a normal schedule and along with that, the chance to partake on all the activities planned for this year.

Before I begin to address 2023, there are a couple of things I would like to share. First, we closed December of 2022 with a great Holiday dinner. The food was wonderful, but the company was even better! I would like to express my gratitude to all the brothers who attended the dinner and shared in celebrating this special season with much brotherly love.

Secondly, I would like to recognize and thank our 2022 officers for giving their time to our Valley and our fraternity, starting with Hon. David Frias, 32° KCCH who served as our Venerable Master in the lodge of Perfection, Bro. Brandon Cook, 32° who served as Wise Master in the Chapter of Rose Croix, Bro. Todd Herschburg, 32° who served as Commander in the Council of Kadosh and Bro. Cristian DeDios, 32°  who served as Master of Kadosh in the Consistory. Please accept our sincere gratitude for your efforts and for helping our Valley navigate some challenging times. I encourage every member to please make the time to personally reach out and thank each of our 2022 officers for their dedication and steady support.

Now on to a New Year. In 2023, we welcome a new line of leaders who are eager to make a significant impact in our Valley. First, congratulations to Bro. Andrew Todd, 32°, for being elected as our Venerable Master. I am certain Bro. Todd will do a magnificent job in leading our Valley this year. We also welcome to Bro. Todd Herschburg, 32°, for being elected as Wise Master, Bro. Matt Gage, 32°, for being elected as Commander and Bro. Luis Carrion, 32°, for being elected as Master of Kadosh. I also would like to congratulate and recognize every brother who has been elected and appointed to serve our Valley in each imperative role. With that said, to all Elected and Appointed brothers, we look forward to your respectable work and continuing dedication to our Valley and our craft. We all appreciate your enthusiasm and continuing support. 

I am excited to share with you that in 2023, we will continue our commitment to provide every brother joining our Valley during the year, an automatic enrollment in the Master Craftsman program as soon as they receive their 32° degree. Allowing every new Scottish Rite member to participate in our Masonic education program provides further light in Masonry. With education being a very important part of our future, Hon. Bro. James McCallion, 32° KCCH, as the Director of the Masonic Education Program, will provide a better experience to all brothers attending this essential part of our growth in our masonic life.

Also, with Hon. Bro. James Cervantes serving as Director of Work, Bro. James McCallion serving as Director of Classroom and Bro. Matthew Gage serving as Director of Ritual, we are in for a breathtaking treat and a much-improved experience. I cannot wait to witness their labor of love during our next Reunion Class, as I am certain it will be a great experience for everyone.  

I would like to also thank Hon. Bro. David Frias, 32° KCCH for serving our Valley as Director and Bro. Todd Herschberg, for serving as Member in the Board of Directors of the California Scottish Rite Foundation and in doing so, representing our Valley and our RiteCare Childhood Language Center of Orange County. We Sincerely appreciate their dedication to our foundation and guardianship of our Language Center.
 
As we continue to work towards a brighter future, I encourage you to get involved and help us improve our Valley for the benefit of our brotherhood. If you are interested in being part of this exciting effort, please contact Ill. Bro. Ralph Shelton, 33° Assistant to the Personal Representative, Administration, or myself. I know you will have a great time helping make our Strategic Initiatives successful.

For those of you who are active in Blue Lodges, please continue to actively promote the Orange County Scottish Rite every time you visit your Lodge. Keep working with non-Scottish Rite Masons by presenting petitions, especially knowing that our Masonic Education program has proven to be successful. We all know new membership continues to be a challenge for many Valleys, but if we make the effort to speak to our Blue Lodges, I am certain that we will make a significant difference in our membership. 

Please encourage our Mason brother to download an application by visiting our main site, www.OCScottishRite.org, and from the “Membership” menu, choose “Application for Degrees”. Have them fill out the application and mail it to our office along with the initiation fee. Just as last year, our goal is to have at least 6 new brothers for each Reunion class. With your help we can do this!

As your Personal Representative, it is my commitment to work hard in reinvigorating our fraternity, so we can increase our membership and our fellowship, all critical to our sustainability and success for many more years to come.

If you have any questions for me, please don’t hesitate to email or call.

My cell number is 714-600-6914, and my email is frosario@OCScottishRite.org.

I look forward to working with you and making a greater difference in 2023!


Fraternally yours,
