# Venerable Master {.first}

Hello my brothers and welcome to the new year and to the new line of officers for 2022. I am very honored to serve as the Venerable Master for this year and I am proud to be serving with all of the other officers.

This year we switched to a Zoom Officer Installation ceremony with a virtual **Illustrious Frank Loui 33º SGIG** as our Installation Officer. **Illustrious Art Salazar 33º** was virtually flawless as our  Master of Ceremony. **Honorable James Cervantes 32º KCCH** delivered an inspiring prayer to bless everyone in attendance. For me it was a memorable time and I wish to say Thank you to everyone involved.

I recently read this quote while looking for information about brotherly love. The author is unknown but I think the message is perfect. 

> There are no strangers in Freemasonry, only friends you’ve yet to meet.  

This is the way I feel about coming to lodge. Sometimes our busy schedules might cause us to find excuses for not coming to lodge. Once I am there I really enjoying greeting all the brothers. Spending time with this great group of men makes the effort so worth while. I strongly encourage everyone to make the time this year to attend our lodge and enjoying a little time with your brothers. I look forward to sharing some brotherly love with you soon!

Sincerely,
