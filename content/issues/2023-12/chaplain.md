The sun sets on another year, only to rise again with promises of rebirth and renewal… 

With the passing of one year into the next, we closed one chapter and started to write anew. It is a time to reflect on what has happened and an opportunity to take the lessons learned and (as I heard recently) make new mistakes. At its core, life is a trial by fire we all must endure. It is how we meet these challenges, how we respond, that is where growth happens. 

So, with January 2024 rapidly approaching us like a freight train, how will you close out 2023? In this season of shared experiences with friends and family, what tiny kindness can you show to ensure the memory of this year is one of positivity? Is there something you’ve held off doing for yourself or others? Is there something left unsaid to a friend or loved one? Think well… after all, we only have thirty-one days left this year!

For me, in this Masonic realm, I will say this. Thank you! Thank you all for being loving and supportive. Thank you for going along with my little hair-brained ideas when we do our reunions. Thank you to those who participated in the ritual during the reunions (hint: if you haven’t done this already… put it on your to-do list for 2024). Thank you to our leadership team for their kind words of support and guidance over the years. Thank you to the sideliners who came to our meetings and made those Monday nights just a little bit more fun! 

As many of you now know, we have a very exciting 2024 in store for our Valley. I’m grateful to see our incoming officers preparing for their new roles in the coming year, and I know it will all end up very successful. So make sure to be involved! We learn by doing. So let’s all put our hands in and do the work that needs to be done for the sake of the Valley, our Brethren, and Mankind as a whole. I look forward to working with as many of you as possible in the reunions, stated meetings, rituals like the ceremony of remembrance and renewal, etc.

I pray for peace and happiness for each of you this holiday season. Surrounded by those who bring love, light, and laughter into your life. May you have joy in abundance and when you can spare it, enough to share with those in need. 

Sincerely and Fraternally,
