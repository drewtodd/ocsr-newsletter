### Symbolism and Rituals in Closure
Freemasonry is renowned for its rich symbolism and intricate rituals, and closure is no exception. During a Masonic ceremony, closure is often marked by specific rituals, symbols, and gestures. These rituals serve as a way for Freemasons to internalize the knowledge they have acquired and to embrace the transformative power of closure.

One example of a symbolic ritual associated with closure is the extinguishing of a candle or the closing of a Masonic lodge. These actions represent the conclusion of a particular Masonic gathering or event, signifying the end of one phase and the beginning of another.

## The Ongoing Journey
While closure marks the end of a particular phase or event, it is important to note that Freemasonry is an ongoing journey. Closure within Freemasonry is not meant to be a final destination, but rather a stepping stone towards further growth and understanding. Each closure opens doors to new opportunities, challenges, and levels of enlightenment, as Freemasons progress through the various degrees and levels within the fraternity.
