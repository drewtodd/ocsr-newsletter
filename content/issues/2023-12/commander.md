Closure is a concept that refers to the process of finding resolution and acceptance after experiencing a significant loss, change, or unanswered question. It involves reaching a point of emotional completeness and understanding, allowing individuals to move forward with their lives. Closure does not necessarily mean forgetting or erasing the past, but rather finding a sense of peace and finality that enables emotional healing. 

Closure can be achieved through different methods, including open communication, self-reflection, and seeking support from others. Engaging in conversations that address unresolved issues, expressing emotions, and gaining insight into the circumstances surrounding a particular event can contribute to closure. Additionally, individuals may find closure through activities that promote self-discovery, such as therapy, journaling, or pursuing new interests. Ultimately, closure is a deeply personal and subjective process that varies from person to person, but its significance lies in the opportunity it provides for emotional healing and the ability to move forward in a more positive and empowered manner.

In addition, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to the two talented brothers from Argentina **Matias Napoli,** an Entered Apprentice from Orange Grove Lodge No. 293 with a degree in Culinary Arts "Le Cordon Bleu" Paris France and **Facundo Pantaleoni** a Fellowcraft from Saint John's Lodge No. 2517 Buenos Aires, Argentina who dedicated their time and culinary expertise to create a truly memorable and delectable super breakfast. Their passion for cooking and attention to detail were evident, making the morning not just a meal but a delightful experience. It was clear that their skills were not just about nourishing the body but also about feeding the soul. The effort and creativity they poured into crafting each element of the breakfast did not go unnoticed, and I am sincerely thankful for the delightful start they provided to our day. It was a gastronomic journey that left a lasting impression, and I feel privileged to have enjoyed such a fantastic breakfast curated by these exceptional chefs from Argentina.

Fraternally,
