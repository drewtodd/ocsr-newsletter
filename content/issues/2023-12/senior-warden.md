My brothers,

I want to thank each and every one of you who were involved with making our education program a success over the last two years. We had a great attendance on Saturday, November 18th, with each of the attendees dialed-in and contributing to an excellent academic discourse.

As this month’s theme is closure, the November 18th event will conclude the classroom lecture series. Please stay tuned via our newsletter and website for further areas of interest.

It has been an honor to serve and I wish you all an excellent month of December.

Sincerely and fraternally,
