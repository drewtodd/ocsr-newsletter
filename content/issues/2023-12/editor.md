You don’t have to be a head of body or a member of the line to contribute to this newsletter! If you have something to say from a masonic perspective — perhaps insights into your masonic ruminations, scholarly endeavors you’d like to share, or general news for the brethren — this newsletter is your conduit for those ideas. I encourage any and all brothers who’d like to contribute something to this newsletter to send their ideas to:

**[editor@ocscottishrite.org](mailto:editor@ocscottishrite.org)**

I’ll work with you on getting your article together for the next issue.

2. Select "Save as PDF" instead of a printer
3. Set the scale to 65%
4. Uncheck "Headers and footers"
