We are saddened by the loss of Ill. Richard Riemer, 33°. Dick, as we all knew him, was a driving force in the founding of our Valley, and served as the Chairman of the Santa Ana (now Orange County) Valley Advisory Committee. His was a devoted Freemason and an invaluable leader, and he will be missed. We were informed of his passing by his son, who has kindly provided the following tribute.

On October 14, 2023, Illustrious Richard L. Riemer – known to his Masonic brethren as “Dick” – passed away at home in the loving care of his wife, Anita. He was 98 years of age.

Dick was instrumental in the formation of our Valley.  In 1976, he was elected as the president of the Orange County Scottish Rite Club, the goal of which was the formation of a new Scottish Rite Valley to serve that county. When Letters Temporary were issued for a Lodge of Perfection in September of 1977, Dick was selected to serve as its Venerable Master, a position he held until January of 1980. Under his leadership, all four Scottish Rite Bodies of what was then called the Valley of Santa Ana were formally chartered.

Meanwhile, also in 1977, Sovereign Grand Commander Henry Clausen named Dick as the Chairman of the Sovereign Grand Inspector General’s Advisory Conference for the Valley, the office now known as the Personal Representative of the Sovereign Grand Inspector General in California. He served in that office until February of 1988. In recognition of his exemplary service during these formative years, Dick was coroneted an Inspector General Honorary in 1979.

His service to the Scottish Rite was only a part of his long record of service to Freemasonry. It began with membership in the Swordsman Chapter of the Order of De Molay in Joliet, Illinois. After returning from World War II, he petitioned Mt. Joliet Lodge #42, AF&AM, and became a Master Mason in 1947. After moving to California, he was one of the founding members of La Mirada Lodge #778, which was constituted in 1957. Dick was its first Senior Steward. In 1961, Dick served as Master of his lodge. His lodge recognized him with the Hiram Award in 1993.

Dick served the Grand Lodge of California as Junior Grand Deacon in 1982 and as Grand Orator in 1983. In addition, he served on Grand Lodge committees for over 30 years, including the committees on Lodge Financing (chair), Constitution Observance (chair), Code Commission, Bylaws (chair), Jurisprudence (chair), and Code Revision (chair).  

He joined the Los Angeles Scottish Rite bodies in 1966, and was decorated a Knight Commander of the Court of Honor in 1973. Before shifting his efforts to the creation of the Valley of Santa Ana, he served as Wise Master of the Los Angeles Chapter Rose Croix in 1974.
He joined El Bekal Shrine Temple in 1984, and served as president of the Valencia Shrine Club in 1986. He served five potentates as Temple Orator.

He also joined the Royal Order of Scotland, the Orange County York Rite Bodies, the National Sojourners, and the Heros of ’76. In short, he was a Mason’s Mason.

Outside of Freemasonry, Dick served in the 102nd Infantry Division of the United States Army during World War II, fighting in the European theater. His National Guard unit was activated during the Korean War. Thereafter, he served for decades in Judge Advocate General’s Corps of the United States Army Reserve, retiring in 1978 with the rank of colonel. Among other civic and professional organizations, he was president both of the La Mirada Homeowners’ Association and of the International Right of Way Association.

In preparation for the first degree of Masonry, we declare that we wish to be serviceable to our fellow creatures. May Dick Riemer’s lifetime of service to his country, his community, his profession, and his fraternity serve as an example to all of us.

He is survived by his loving wife, Anita, his older son Rick and daughter-in-law Susan, his younger son Craig and daughter-in-law Maria, three step-children (Lillemor, Tina, and James), two grandsons, and a great-granddaughter. His first wife, Lois, predeceased him in 1985.

Sincerely and fraternally,
