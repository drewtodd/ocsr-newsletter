The Holiday Season is upon us and the 2023 is nearly over. This provides with a good opportunity to examine our Valley and see what we have accomplished this year and what we can improve on in the next year. We have brought in interested, new members through our 2 Reunions in 2023. The numbers of new members for the year is the highest since well before the pandemic. More importantly, these new Brothers have a profound interest in learning more about the 29 degrees of the Scottish Rite through attendance at Reunions and our Masonic education events.This is very positive.

> On Monday, December 4th, we are having our Stated Meeting at 6:30 pm. The meeting will be followed by Christmas Party and dinner for our Orange County Childhood Language Center. Please make a point of attending as this is a fun event.

As for an area where we can show improvement, our attendance at Stated Meetings is growing. However, we would like to see higher attendance. The meetings are relatively short and deal with Valley business. The fellowship comes after the meeting where we are having better meals and frequent speakers. 

On Monday, December 4th, we are having our Stated Meeting at 6:30 pm. The meeting will be followed by Christmas Party and dinner for our Orange County Childhood Language Center. This event is attended by the children and their families. The kids will be receiving gifts. Please make a point of attending as this is a fun event.

May the Holidays be full of happiness for you and your families.

Sincerely and Fraternally,
