Brethren: Hope you are enjoying the summer. It is time for our annual mention of our Valley organization called the Century Club. All donations made by Brothers to the Century Club go entirely to our Valley. As our Valley is entirely a volunteer organization, all funds go to office and meeting hall rent, office and fraternal supplies, and general Valley expenses. Membership is $100 per year. If you have any questions about this club, please contact our office. And, we thank all of  our Brothers who are current Century Club members. 

>  Attending our next Stated Meeting on August 7th at 6:30 pm at the DeMolay Center is a great opportunity to reconnect with your Valley. 
   
With new programs at our Stated Meetings such as dinner speakers and Masonic education seminars every few months on a Saturday, we are reaching out to our members who may have drifted away from active participation in our Valley. Attending our next Stated Meeting on August 7th at 6:30 pm at the DeMolay Center is a great opportunity to reconnect with your Valley. 

If you or any of your friends have fallen behind on your Scottish Rite dues or been suspended, do not hesitate to contact the office if you are interested in reactivating your membership. We have programs in place for becoming current or reactivating your membership at a favorable cost. Contact the Secretary at the Valley office if you have any questions regarding your membership. Stay well and we look forward to seeing you at our next Valley meeting.

Sincerely and Fraternally,
