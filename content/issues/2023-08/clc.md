Greetings and happy summer from the RiteCare Childhood Language Center of Orange County! This summer semester was filled with summer-themed therapy sessions for our children who attend our clinic for their speech and language needs. 

This summer we tried something different – group therapy sessions! About half of our children were paired in groups of 2 to learn and grow in their communication with a same-aged peer. Our children thrived and greatly enjoyed making new friends this summer.

Parents also enjoyed the new look of our waiting room with summer-themed decorations for younger siblings to enjoy while they wait. Additionally, parents were offered summer-themed activities for following directions and vocabulary to take home for practice with their kiddos. 

This summer our graduate student clinicians were preparing to graduate at the end of the semester, and excelled in their clinical skills for providing evaluations and therapy services to our children. It was thrilling to see their hard work over the last two years in action with our group sessions for the wide-range of speech and language needs our children have. 

We have completed our summer semester with several new families anticipated to join us here at RiteCare CLC. We look forward to seeing our new graduate student clinicians, our children, and their families in the Fall! 

Sincerely,
