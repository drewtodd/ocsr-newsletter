Fraternity: What is it, and what’s the point?

I’ve had the fortunate experience and pleasure of being a member of several fraternities ranging from academic, social, political, religious, spiritual, and Masonic, and I have observed that members have different views on how they define Fraternity.

Everybody Googles, so I did a simple search on Quora: “What is a fraternity and what is the point of joining a fraternity?” Generally speaking, most of the responses danced around “Fraternity life” as offering many benefits. They suggested that friendships, fellowship, bonding, brotherhood, identification with a group, sharing of ideas, developing meaningful relationships, leadership development, scholarship, and philanthropy were all aspects of Fraternity, which contribute to the experience as a whole.

All of these are true and meaningful to the individual, but scholarship deeply resonates with me. Having a rich understanding of our history and philosophy and how obtaining that knowledge and facilitating its subsequent wisdom sculpts us as members within our organizations. 

As director of education, I would be remiss not to emphasis the importance of Scottish Rite education, but honestly, I advocate all of the education programs throughout the Masonic family should you be a member. Did you know that other bodies in Freemasonry have education programs too? You can find the first 3 degrees of blue lodge masonry and lodge management education on iMember.  Scottish Rite has an entire online college (5 Master Craftsman courses) and Guthrie Valley offers the College of the Consistory and the Academy of Reflection (we have a chapter here in OC).  The York Rite has the Companion Adept of the Temple Program and a York Rite Leadership Program. Masonic research bodies have education programs as well!

> Fraternity to me has always been a safe space where we can take the time to do the inner work and attempt to perfect our own temple through familiarizing ourselves with the literature and discovering how that wisdom translates best into action.

Why is scholarship important? Let me ask you… 

Which two degrees (within the 1st through 32nd degree system) are the explicit reason why the Scottish Rite employs language centers and speech pathology as its philanthropy? Why?

Perhaps an easier question; Why is the rough ashlar actually perfect?

Or, which two themes are actually under consideration when we attempt to achieve balance in our lives (“good versus evil” is incorrect)?

I can’t begin to explain the beautiful connections and a-ha’s I have encountered in this pursuit. The forefathers and authors of Freemasonry alone have veiled and revealed (or actually “re-veiled” – those that know, know) a philosophy that is just absolutely delicious to read (if you have the patience to translate the message). What I feel is missing in the modern mind is ancient wisdom and that is unquestionably found as an untapped resource within our craft, especially in the Scottish Rite, the University of Freemasonry.

Fraternity to me has always been a safe space where we can take the time to do the inner work and attempt to perfect our own temple through familiarizing ourselves with the literature and discovering how that wisdom translates best into action.  

In my experience, Masonry has been the most gentle, caring and considerate fraternity, where we provide the latitude for a brother to suppose a notion, and not immediately be stricken down because it is different, or requires a stretch of the imagination, or an extension of faith. For this I am truly grateful.

I don’t know everything, but as our beloved past personal representative Pete Jantz, 33° said… “There’s a book on that!” Reach-out to me if any of this interests you, I’d be glad to share the resources I have thusfar uncovered.

*P.S. Come to August’s stated meeting and I’ll provide a brief explanation to the posed questions above.*


Sincerely and fraternally,
