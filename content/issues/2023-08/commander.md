Greetings Brethren,

I trust this message finds you and your loved ones enjoying a splendid summer. As we embark on the latter half of the year, we are preparing ourselves for a bustling autumn season. Notably, the eagerly anticipated super breakfast has been rescheduled for November, and we aim to make it an extraordinary affair. If you wish to contribute to this momentous occasion, kindly reach out to us at your earliest convenience. Please get in touch with Brother Alejo Velarde at 714-720-5178 or email him at broalejo293@gmail.com.

Furthermore, I encourage you all to mark your calendars for our next meeting, which is scheduled for August 7th. Your presence and participation would be greatly appreciated. May July bring you an abundance of joy and fulfillment. 

Wishing you all the best,
