Brethren: Hope you are having a good start to the Summer. This season is a great time to attend a Stated Meeting of the Orange County Valley. Attendance has improved at our meetings in 2023. Part of this due to our Junior Warden Larry Griffin 32° providing us with high quality meals. Also, we had an excellent presentation on Masonry & Magic from Ralph Shelton 33° after a recent meeting.  

> This season is a great time to attend a Stated Meeting of the Orange County Valley.

In May, we held our Spring Super Breakfast at the DeMolay Center. We want to thank all the Brothers who purchased tickets for this event. Also, hearty thanks to the crew of Brothers who came in early and worked the entire breakfast. The 2 Super Breakfasts are the only fundraisers we hold where the proceeds go directly to our Valley. The profit from the most recent breakfast helps to pay our rent, office expenses, Reunions and Masonic education seminars. This was the most successful breakfast we have had since before the pandemic.  
 
We are receiving petitions from Master Masons to receive the degrees of the Scottish Rite. We thank our members from Lodges in South Orange County who have been most active in bringing in new members. We have a great deal to offer to the Master Mason who is seeking more light in the Craft. If we don’t let our Blue Lodge Brothers know about our Valley, they are unlikely to seek membership.  Our Stated Meeting is on June 5th at 6:30 pm at the DeMolay Center. Summer dress is business casual. If you make a point of attending, you will be pleased that you did. Have an outstanding Summer. 

Fraternally,
