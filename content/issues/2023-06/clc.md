Welcome back to the RiteCare center or Orange County!  Everyone is ready and hopeful for a glimpse of summer but it seems like summer is being shy this year.

Holiday and seasonal themes provide excellent content for Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) to incorporate into their therapy sessions in order to enhance speech development. Here are some wonderful examples of how our student clinicians are utilizing  them in their work with the children:

1. **Vocabulary Expansion:** Student clinicians are introducing and reinforcing seasonal or holiday-related vocabulary words. They engage children in conversations about weather changes, seasonal activities, traditional holiday foods, and specific holiday-related terms. The children love learning about the holidays so they don’t even notice that the student clinicians are helping to expand their vocabulary and promote their language development.

2. **Storytelling and Narrative Skills:** Student clinicians  use seasonal or holiday-themed stories to improve children's narrative skills. They will read or create stories about holiday traditions, seasonal adventures, or related characters, and then encourage the  children to retell or create their own stories based on these themes, thereby helping to  develop the students’ storytelling abilities and language comprehension.  (Who wouldn’t love reading a good story to a child!)

3. **Articulation Practice:** Student clinicians are also  designing  speech exercises around seasonal or holiday-related words that specifically target a child's speech sound errors. For example, when a child struggles with the /s/ sound, the SLP will create exercises involving words like "snow," "sleigh," or "Santa." This makes practice more engaging and relevant to the child's experiences.

4. **Social Communication Skills:** Seasonal and holiday events provide opportunities to practice social communication skills as well. Student clinicians  simulate or initiate role-play conversations related to specific events, such as greeting others during a holiday party, discussing gift ideas, or sharing experiences from a seasonal outing. These activities are helping children develop pragmatic language skills and improve social interactions.

5. **Following Directions and Sequencing:** Student clinicians typically use seasonal or holiday-related tasks to practice following directions and sequencing skills. For example, they will provide instructions for creating a seasonal craft or decorating a holiday tree. This helps the children improve their listening comprehension, auditory processing, and organizational skills.

By incorporating seasons and holidays into their therapy sessions, the student clinicians are successfully  creating engaging and meaningful activities that support speech development, vocabulary acquisition, storytelling skills and social communication.  What a great way for the children to have fun and improve their communication skills!
