## Super Breakfast was a Success!

Have you heard the sizzle, witnessed the steam, and savored the delectable feast? Last month's Super Breakfast fundraiser was an absolute triumph! We unleashed an explosion of waffles, custom omelets, bacon, sausage, and an impressive array of breakfast delights. There was enough food to satisfy an army! Our taste buds rejoiced in delight.

But it wasn't just about the culinary extravaganza (though that was certainly a major highlight). It was about the spirit of camaraderie, the joy of reconnecting, and the unbridled mirth. Witnessing our brothers gather in one place, sharing laughter, exchanging stories, and fostering a deeper bond over a scrumptious breakfast was truly a magical experience.

To everyone who graced us with their presence, indulged in our culinary delights, and contributed generously, we extend a heartfelt thank you. Your attendance meant the world to us, and your kind contributions will make a tangible difference.

## Embracing The Stoic Wisdom of Marcus Aurelius

Greetings brothers. After a deep dive into the philosophy of Epictetus last month, we journey now to the heart of the Roman Empire, guided by the ruminations of Marcus Aurelius, Rome's philosopher king.

Marcus Aurelius reigned as Emperor from 161 to 180 AD, a period known as the Pax Romana or Roman Peace. Despite dealing with the pressures of power, war, and a devastating plague, Aurelius still found the time and energy to jot down his thoughts and observations on life. This collection, known today as "[Meditations](https://a.co/d/aynz40N)", serves as a remarkable source of wisdom and is a cornerstone of Stoic philosophy.

From the beginning, it's clear that Marcus Aurelius's life was no walk in the park. Yet, his writings display an enduring tranquility, resilience, and focus on moral virtue, mirroring the Stoic belief that we don't control what happens to us, but we can control how we respond.

> "You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength." -- Marcus Aurelius

Aurelius highlighted the power of perspective. He wrote, "You have power over your mind - not outside events. Realize this, and you will find strength." This echoes Epictetus's teachings and underscores the essence of Stoic philosophy: it's not circumstances that disturb us, but our judgments about them. In today's world, these words ring as true as ever. Think about that the next time you find yourself stuck in traffic or grappling with a tough project.

Marcus Aurelius was deeply reflective, continually questioning his beliefs and actions. He urged the importance of rational thinking, writing, "Everything we hear is an opinion, not a fact. Everything we see is a perspective, not the truth." This is a timely reminder to remain open-minded and avoid falling into the trap of cognitive biases, something we can all strive to achieve in our Masonic pursuits and daily interactions.

The Emperor's concept of interconnectedness is another central theme. He believed that we are all part of a larger, universal whole, stating, "We are made for cooperation, like feet, like hands, like eyelids, like the rows of the upper and lower teeth." This belief can nurture a sense of community, something intrinsic to Freemasonry. It encourages us to not only support and uplift one another but also remember that our individual actions impact our collective experience.

> "Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize?" -- Marcus Aurelius

Marcus Aurelius also advocated for humility, kindness, and understanding towards others. His advice, "Whenever you are about to find fault with someone, ask yourself the following question: What fault of mine most nearly resembles the one I am about to criticize?" encourages us to reflect on ourselves before passing judgment, promoting empathy and personal growth.

The philosopher king was also known for his thoughts on mortality. "Death, like birth, is a secret of nature," he noted, implying that death is a part of life and should not be feared. This can help us view our existence from a more expansive perspective, understand the brevity of life, and focus on what truly matters.

While Marcus Aurelius lived almost two millennia ago, his Stoic teachings remain profoundly relevant. His reflections provide practical guidance on resilience, empathy, and understanding – virtues that can benefit us individually and collectively as Masons.

As we continue our exploration of Stoicism, let us embrace the wisdom of Marcus Aurelius. Let us strive to control our responses to external events, be open to different perspectives, remember our interconnectedness, practice kindness, and embrace the natural cycle of life.

> "Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one." <br> -- Marcus Aurelius

In closing, it is worth pondering these words from Aurelius: "Waste no more time arguing about what a good man should be. Be one." As Masons, let’s continue to strive for self-improvement, and remember that our actions often speak louder than our words.

Join me next month as we begin to dive into the actual machinations of Stoic philosophy, merging the important ideas and philosophies of Musonius Rufius, Seneca, Epectitus, and Marcus Aurelius and looking at Stoicism from a practical perspective.

Until then, be well brothers.
