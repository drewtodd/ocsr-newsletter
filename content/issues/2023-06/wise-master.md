Time is central to our experience of the world. We measure it in seconds, minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, and years. We use it to organize our lives, schedule appointments, plan events, and set goals. We (ideally) devote a third of our time to labor, a third for refreshment, and a third for service.

In Masonry, time is seen as a valuable resource that should be used wisely. Our fraternity emphasizes the importance of making the most of every moment, recognizing that our time on earth is limited. We are encouraged to live with a sense of purpose and to use our time in service to others, striving to make a positive impact on the world.  Time is seen as a symbol of the passage of life, with each moment representing an opportunity to grow, learn, and improve. We are taught to view time as a gift that should not be wasted, but rather embraced and cherished.

The passage of time is also a reminder of our mortality. As we grow older and experience the passing of time, we are reminded of the fragility of life and the need to make the most of every moment. Masonry encourages us to reflect on the brevity of our existence and to use our time wisely, focusing on what is truly important in life.

We are also encouraged to live in the present moment, while also recognizing the importance of learning from the past and planning for the future. We are encouraged to reflect on our experiences and to use them to inform our decisions and actions. At the same time, we are reminded that the future is uncertain and that we must be prepared for whatever challenges lie ahead.

The Masonic concept of time is also closely tied to the idea of tradition. As a fraternity with a rich history and tradition, Masonry places great value on preserving the wisdom and teachings of the past. We recognize that our present and future are built upon the foundations laid by those who came before us, and we strive to honor their legacy by continuing to uphold the principles of Masonry in our daily lives.

Sincerely & Fraternally,
