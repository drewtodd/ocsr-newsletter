February is upon us and we have installed a new slate of officers for our Valley. We wish the greatest success for Venerable Master Andrew Todd 32° and all of our new officers in 2023. For your OCSR membership to be current, you need to have paid your 2023 dues. As Supreme now mails out the dues cards along with dues notices, some Brothers do not realize that they have not paid their dues. Possessing a 2023 dues card does not necessarily indicate that your membership is current. If you have any questions whatsoever about your dues status, don't hesitate to contact the Valley office at the email address or phone number below.

In the last year, there have been changes and improvements to the Master Craftsman education program. If you want to explore further light in Masonry, this is the program for you. Online registration is easy via a [link on the OCSR  Valley website](https://www.ocscottishrite.org/classroom-lecture-series/). 

Our Spring Reunion is coming up on April 21st and April 22nd. We are looking for good candidates for initiation. If you need a petition, they are available on the website or contact the Valley office. 

Lastly, remember that the rewards of your Scottish Rite membership are directly related to your active participation in our Valley. 

Fraternally,
