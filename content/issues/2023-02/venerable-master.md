## Stoicism and Freemasonry: A Perfect Pair
As I go through my year in the Venerable Master’s chair, I though that I’d focus on some philosophical ideas and topics that I’ve been studying for several years that I think fit nicely with the ideals of Freemasonry; specifically the philosophy of **the Stoics**. 

Stoicism and Freemasonry might not seem like a natural match at first, but dig a little deeper and you'll see just how well they complement each other. Stoicism, the ancient Greek philosophy that's still as relevant today as it was 2,000 years ago, focuses on self-control, rationality, and inner peace. Freemasonry, on the other hand, is all about ethical behavior, personal growth, and making a positive impact in the world. So, how do these two philosophies fit together so well?

First off, Stoicism is all about self-mastery. Stoics believe that by keeping a handle on our emotions and desires, we can live a life that's peaceful and fulfilling. 

Freemasonry echoes this sentiment, encouraging members to work towards self-improvement and mastery of their passions. It's a way to become the best version of yourself and make a difference in the world.

Next up, Stoicism teaches us to accept what we can't change. The philosophy encourages us to focus on what's within our control and not waste energy on things outside of our reach. Freemasonry shares this idea, asking members to live in harmony with the world and embrace what can't be changed. It's a way to find peace and happiness, no matter what life throws at you.

Finally, Stoicism and Freemasonry both emphasize the importance of moral and ethical behavior. Stoics believe that we should always act in accordance with reason and virtue, while Freemasonry asks members to live by the principles of brotherhood, charity, and truth. By doing so, we can lead lives that are fulfilling and meaningful, making a positive impact on those around us.

So, there you have it! Stoicism and Freemasonry might seem like an unlikely pair, but they're actually a match made in philosophical heaven. Both emphasize self-mastery, acceptance, and moral behavior, offering a powerful framework for personal growth and development. 

Whether you're a fan of Stoicism or a proud member of the Masonic Fraternity, these two philosophies have something to offer.

Until next time brothers, be well.
