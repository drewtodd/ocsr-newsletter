Happy New Year Everyone! I want to congratulate Brother Andrew Todd for being elected Venerable Master of our Valley for 2023. When I started my year as Venerable Master I did receive a lot of help from the Brothers so I know that Andrew will be in our good hands. Luckily we were able to meet in person for most of 2022. Dinners got better and attendance gradually improved. Lets keep up the momentum in 2023 by getting more brothers to come back to our Stated Meetings. I hope to see you all there!  

Here is a quick recap of my Resolutions for 2022 and I’ll give a grade of 1 to 5 with 5 being best on how well I achieved that item on my list.

- Be Early - 2
- Be Present - 4
- Exercise More - 5
- Learn something New - 1
- Learn to play golf - 5 
- Eat more Leafy vegetables - 5

I’m going to add some of these same resolutions for the new year of 2023 and pick some new ones.

- **Be Early** - instead of procrastinating on everything try and get things done early.  For example get my article written early instead of always turning it in late.
- **Learn something New** - I’m probably never going to learn Spanish but I want to keep the brain working so I’ll be more open to learning anything new this year.
- **Exercise More** - Even though I think I crushed this topic last year it is important enough to keep going this year.
- **Lose Weight** - I lost about 12 pounds last year but I still have about another 20 pounds to go.
- **Enjoy Hobbies** - I like to fly drones and take pictures but I don’t do it enough.  Lets see if I can get more time in on these activities.

That is it for 2023.  Wish me well and let me know what resolutions you are picking for yourself.

Sincerely,
