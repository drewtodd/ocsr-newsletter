Greetings brothers, and a happy 2023 to you. With this new year, I hope that you and yours are able to find health, peace, and prosperity, and I look forward to another year of brotherhood with all of you. I wanted to take a few lines to thank you all for your support this year, not the least of whom include:<br><br>

- Brothers **Brandon Cook**, **Todd Herschberg**, and **Kris DeDios** for their brotherhood and support as Heads of Body
- Honorable brother **David Frias** for handling the Venerable Master role so deftly and setting such a fine example for me as a I move into that chair at the head of the Lodge of Perfection.
- Honorable brother **James Olivier** for setting the stage for me as Senior Warden (and guiding me through the ceremonial duties)
- Honorable brother **James McCallion** for his support and advice
- Honorable brother **Jamie Hopkins** for doing the -- often thankless -- job of General Secretary with dignity and dedication
- Illustrious brother **Ralph Shelton** for his encouragement and advice
- Illustrios brother **Frankie Rosario** for the support, enablement, and encouragemnt that allowed me to be successful in my role

Finally, a big thanks to all the brothers who came out, broke bread, and shared in our traditions during a year that was at times difficutl, transformative, and engaging. I look forward to the great honor of serving you all as Venerable Master this year. It is my hope and ambition to live up to the examples set by the excellent brothers who have come before me.

See you all at Installation on January 15th.

Until next month, be well, brothers.
