Greetings from the West!

If you weren’t already aware, Art de Hoyos has published a reprint of Albert Pike’s “The Porch and the Middle Chamber: The Book of the Lodge.” In brief, this book touches upon the first 3 degrees of Scottish Rite Masonry. [In speaking of Albert Pike’s effort] “It was prepared to provide Scottish Rite Masons with the lessons necessary to understand the higher degrees of Masonry more fully (de Hoyos).”

This book, and many other wonderful volumes of Craft Knowledge is provided free to each member of the Scottish Rite Research Society. If you are not a member of the SSRS, I would highly recommend committing to the $55 yearly dues fee. Some of these books are estimated to be hundreds of dollars, and the content: invaluable!

Ill. DeHoyos has also given mention that he may consider creating yet another Master Craftsman program based on this book!

Want to nerd-out? Reach out anytime to discuss this, Master Craftsman, or all things Masonic Education. I’d love to hear from you!
