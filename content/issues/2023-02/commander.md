## Isaac Newton and The Occult

Isaac Newton, the famous English mathematician and scientist, who has been ranked as the second most influential person in all of human history (beating out Jesus Christ in third place and coming up short behind Muhammad in first place), would not be the first name to come to mind when thinking of the occult.  However, Newton had a private side to him that he preferred to keep hidden from public view.  In addition to producing many scientific manuscripts, Newton also wrote many manuscripts on alchemy.  In fact, it’s estimated that as much as 10% of all the words Newton wrote in his manuscripts were about alchemy.  There is a beautiful quote from the British economist, John Maynard Keyes, who later purchased some of Newton’s manuscripts, that nicely sums up Newton’s relationship with the occult:

“Newton was not the first of the age of reason.  He was the last of the magicians… He looked on the whole universe and all that is in it as a riddle, as a secret which could be read by applying pure thought to certain evidence, certain mystic clues which God had laid about to allow a sort of philosopher’s treasure hunt to the esoteric brotherhood.  He believed that these clues were to be found partly in the evidence of the heavens and in the constitution of elements, … but also partly in certain papers and traditions handed down by the brethren in an unknown chain back to the original cryptic revelation in Babylonia.”

Newton thus saw there was a connection between science and religion that found its synthesis in mysticism.  He believed that the Universe contained countless secrets that were revealed by careful study through science and thus revealed more of the nature of God.  This point is mentioned in the Tenth Degree of Morals and Dogma, where Albert Pike says how Newton came to his conclusions “by the steps of an ascending Geometry, to the mechanism of the Heavens.”

Some of Newton’s beliefs were probably private out of necessity to remain out of the watchful eye of the Catholic Church.  Galileo was tried before the Inquisition in this same century for his belief that the Earth revolved around the Sun.  Newton’s exact religious beliefs are still unclear, but he was definitely some kind of an anti-trinitarian.  He was very familiar with the Bible, early biblical writings, and the debates that went on among the early church fathers–in particular Arius and Athanasius.  The emperor Constantine ultimately sided with Athanasius, and the rest is history.  The doctrine of Arius–that Jesus was only human and was thus not truly divine–was one that Newton was undoubtedly familiar with and most likely espoused.  Although he predated formal Freemasonry by over a hundred years, Newton’s personal beliefs showed a more tolerant version of religion that would become a hallmark of our Craft.
