## On Brotherhood

Brotherhood for Freemasons is the embodiment of our core ethical values that we all adherents share in common. Our brotherhood is based on the concept of ‘brotherly love’, that is a type of shared compassion and mutual understanding which make us all part of a larger collective. It encourages us to strive to help others, support our fellow members and be positively engaged in our community. Brotherhood is also an expression of universal fraternalism, a community of shared ideals and bonds of friendship.

At its simplest, brotherhood is a way to express moral and ethical principles. The brotherhood of Freemasons is based on three key principles: brotherly love, relief (or charity) and truth. Brotherly love is the cornerstone which binds members of the organization together. It is a bond of loyalty and friendship that allows us to look out for one another. It is unconditional love, based on mutual respect and appreciation, which accepts and encourages the differences between culture, religion, backgrounds and beliefs.

Relief is an expression of caring for the well-being of others. Members of Freemasonry exercise their capacity to help those in need, especially those in their own Fraternity and the greater community in general. This can manifest in different ways such as providing financial assistance, knowledge, comfort or guidance.

Truth is a core value of Freemasonry. It is what binds members together and encourages mutual understanding. It is through active dialogue, free from judgement and bias, that members learn and grow. Truth is a way to develop meaningful understanding, reconcile differences and reach common goals.

Ultimately, brotherhood is an expression of shared values, compassion and mutual understanding. It is a way to originate and express moral exemplars that promote the well-being of individuals and the community as a whole. All members of Freemasonry should endeavour to embody these values and work together in the spirit of brotherhood.

Fraternally,
