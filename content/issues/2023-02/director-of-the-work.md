I write this while sitting in my home office. I have art, a wall full of books, my two mooching free-loading cats, and my incredible wife. I have my friends. I have my family. I have my brothers. I just opened a project that is bringing smiles to people’s faces. For a lack of a better way of saying it; life could be worse.

What are you thankful for? What drives you? What makes you get up in the morning wanting to be better than the day before? 

Being thankful for the things we have is an easy step. Sometimes it’s something we’ve been given, and sometimes it’s the people who we’re surrounded by… sometimes it’s the random kindness from a stranger. But here’s the real question… 

What are you doing to give someone else a reason to be thankful for something? We each have our own gifts. How do you use yours? 

Me? I try every day to bring a smile to someone’s face. I try to help my Brethren learn and grow. I truly try to leave this world just a little bit better than I found it. 

Do what you can to enrich the world around you! Give others a reason to be thankful, and the gratitude will be returned to you in kind. 

Sincerely and Fraternally,
