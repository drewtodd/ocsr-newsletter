Welcome to the Rite Childhood Language Center of Orange County.  The new year has started off with great excitement! We are pleased to be back in the clinic with a new group of Graduate student clinicians and some new children. As always, we love to see our families and children returning, and there are many of them!  We have hit the ground running, having already completed some new evaluations as well as  adding new kids to the caseloads. 

For many of our student clinicians, this is their first time working with this  young  age group in a clinical setting. It is exciting to witness their enthusiasm and eagerness to continue learning and growing in their practice. All the supervisors are relish the opportunity to watch each of them grow in their clinical skills.

Our retuning families are ready to work and eager to meet the new student clinicians. In just a few short weeks, we have already begun to  see some improvements in many of the  childrens’ communication skills. The continued efforts of Parents, children and student clinicians  working diligently together as a team is the reason our children are starting to strengthen and improve their language skills.

As always, student clinicians  are all very grateful for the experience and opportunity the clinic affords for them  to improve their practices. The families are constantly thanking us for the services and the life changing help that is we provide. Every supervisor agrees they thoroughly enjoy the ability to be a part of this amazing opportunity to provide the  gift of communication and confidence to our families.  



Sincerely,
