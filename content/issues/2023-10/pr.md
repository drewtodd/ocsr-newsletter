October is a versatile month - Fall leaves, spooky decor and for our Valley, our Fall Reunion. We have several candidates for this class, and I am excited to meet them.

As our Valley improves engagement, consider inviting your significant other to attend. Spouse, partner, whatever the label, they will be welcomed by the other ladies to enjoy their time of fellowship and activity while we conduct our business, and then we all join for dinner and program. Those of you who missed this meeting also missed a surprise visit from our Sovereign Grand Inspector General, Ill. Frank Loui and his delightful wife, Jeanie.

Special mention should be made of those who jumped in at the last minute to help. As you will read elsewhere, we have some officers become unavailable on short notice due to family medical issues and their own illness, but our meeting went forward smoothly. Hon. Mike Gowder stepped into the role of Venerable Master to run the meeting, Bro. Shawn Bell stood in as Master of Kadosh, and Hon. Chris de Dios filled in as Commander of Kadosh.

I was pleased to be at Honours on Saturday, September 9, in Long Beach, as Hon. Charles Cross received his KCCH, and look forward to Bro. Andrew Todd having his communicated in the immediate future. Andrew was unable to attend, but will be back with us soon, and I'm sure that red cap will look great on him.

Finally, I know you all want to improve engagement and attendance, and you can make that happen without a whole lot of effort. While attending just the things I normally would - craft lodge meetings, a few area events, that sort of thing, I make a point to remind brothers I know to be members of the Valley to come to the next meeting. The result was half a dozen brothers we haven't seen in a while being with is in September, including Ill. Lloyd Clayton, who we have dearly missed. If you just add that reminder to your usual greeting, you'll bring brothers back to the Valley, and it's a great place to be. Also keep in mind that if they need transportation or any other form of assistance, we are there for them. Just reach out to the General Secretary.

Sincerely and fraternally,
