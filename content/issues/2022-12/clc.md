November was a fun and exciting month for our families here at CLC! The Fall decorations in the clinic make the clients feel enthusiastic for the Thanksgiving holiday and the time they will spend with family.  We are officially entering the “Holiday Season”!

This month we’ve continued to see an increase in families reaching out to CLC for assessment and therapy services. The student clinicians have been learning so much in their second year of their graduate program, providing our children with the support in speech and language to help them find their future voice. Each student clinician brings a unique approach to how they work with the kids, making them feel special and important in their own way. Whether it’s craft skills, knowledge of what cartoons are popular right now, or just great enthusiasm, our student clinicians come here ready to help and our clients, and leave each session excited to come back the following week!

As for the children, they continue to learn new skills to improve their speech sounds and language to communicate with their friends and families. It is truly a gift to see their growth and happiness each day they come to our clinic. It’s a special treat to see them continue to learn all their speech and language skills while enjoying crafts and games to celebrate the holidays.

We wouldn’t be able to do all that we do for our families and for the community without all of the support we receive for our clinic. We are so grateful for the opportunity to give back and thoroughly enjoy watching our clients and student clinicians thriving every day. 

Sincerely,
