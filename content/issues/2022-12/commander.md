The year draws to a close and, with it, we can put the labors of yesterday behind us.  The cycle of the year gives us the opportunity to reflect on the past and let it go.  Closure doesn't mean that we deny it happened, nor that things from the past have no validity nor value.

Closure instead provides us with a sense of the future - that every door that is an exit can also be an entrance to something new.  Embrace, therefore, the things you leave behind - the unburdening of the past leaves you lighter, more nimble, and better able to face the tasks ahead.

Let us then, in the coming weeks, bid a fond farewell to 2022 - to the good and the bad - and stride forth into 2023, armed with a fresh outlook and a readiness to face whatever comes our way.

What will 2023 bring?  We'll know when it happens - no sooner.  What we do know is that it, like all years, will bring us laughter and tears, war and peace, suffering and solace, birth and death.  At the end of the year, we will once again look back - fondly on the good, and sadly upon the bad.  Then in the immortal words of Elsa from Frozen - we will "let it go"... and move forward, unburdened, into 2024.
