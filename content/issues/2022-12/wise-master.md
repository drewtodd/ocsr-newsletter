Greetings Brethren,

The Soviet astronomer Nikolai Kardashev effectively proposed that the measure of a civilization’s level of technological advancement is based on the amount of energy it is able to harness. It is no wonder that population centers tend to gravitate near sources of abundant energy (eg water) where positive externalities of growth can endure while innovation pushes us forward in our endless pursuit of advancement. Productive activity including philosophical arrangement is drawn towards these energy centers as fertile grounds of development and groups such as our Scottish Rite can proliferate.

As we embark on the festive season of the year, we remember Albert Mackey describing the modern Rose Croix, constituting the summit of the French Rite. Inspired by those who still believe that the act of one individual seeking to make himself a better human being through knowledge of philosophy, religion, and the arts, can indeed effect a positive change for the benefit of all humanity. A vision of how the world ought to be if only we would shift our mental focus to an awareness of the greater macrocosm beyond ourselves.

In closure, I will attempt to bring these words full circle by quoting Brother Charles ‘Chic’ Cicero in his article The Rosicrucian Impulse: Magic, Mysticsm, and Ritual. The Rose Croix speaks to the spirit of Western man in a way that cannot be measured by science nor confirmed by historians. It speaks to the human heart so long as it feels that the essence and principles behind them are true and right. It is the truth of the soul. The actual existence of an original “secret society” of illuminated masters is of little importance compared to the values and ideology its legend continues to inspire. The symbolism of the Rose and Cross, is basic and archetypal to the Western mind. It affects us deeply and powerfully. In addition to reminding us of our Christian values, the cross is a complex symbol which includes the meaning of conjunction, the binding together of opposing forces. The cross is a symbol of the heart, of the mystic center of the universe, a place of junction for the forces of the cosmos. The rose is primarily a symbol of completion, achievement, purity, and perfection. The rose and cross together refer to the synthesis of these ideas.

A little more from Brother Cicero, “Our order is inherently Christian, although it embraces the wisdom of those ancient pagan philosophers who formulated the first concepts about the nature of the divine universe, the transcendence of God and the evolution of the human soul. It advocates personal understanding of the divine, through the discipline of esoteric studies and spiritual exercises. It embraces the sciences of the ancient world. It suggests that theurgy, magic, and mystical rites are important tools whereby the soul communicates with God. It promotes the healing of humanity."

Finally, as Dame Frances Yates summed it all up, “To the genuine Mason, the religious side of the movement was always the most important.” I wish you all a very happy and merry Christmas.

In our calls to the Almoner, remember Brethren: He who giveth to charity, lendeth to the Lord.

Sincerely & Fraternally,
