Greetings to all, 

As we approach the end of the year for many people, the winter solstice marks much more than just the shortest day. Throughout history, societies around the world have held ceremonies and festivals to mark the day of the sun's rebirth. It symbolizes life, death, and human connection with nature's most powerful force. For me, as I write this I am currently mourning the death of a beloved woman which is my girlfriends mother. I’m deeply saddened and experiencing the feeling of heartbreak with my second family. Losing a mother and or a wife is probably one of the most heartbreaking moments in anyones life. 

Just like the sun or  moon it’s light that you expect to be there to always greet you in the morning or say good night to you before you fall asleep. Without the sun or moon present we’re in the dark. The father as our sun brings light to his family in the day and his strength gives our mother moon peace and light to comfort us at night before we go to bed. One without the other reduces the light we receive in our lives. 

Together, our fathers and mothers bring harmony in our lives. They help us feel complete in a way. Our mother provide us a sense of peace, affection, and unconditional love most of the time. Our fathers provide us strength, guidance, and protection. At this moment there is a lack of light in my family but I’m so proud that I can provide wisdom, strength and a perspective of beauty in someones death. I can help my family understand that death isn’t a vicious ugly thing. Its only a beginning or new understanding of spiritual awareness. Of how our conscious is also power, of how our selfless actions and love that we spread comfort others when we are gone. Those beautiful acts of kindness, those inspiring moments stay in our hearts forever. 

With that being said brethren, thank you for your efforts and dedication in keeping our fraternity ALIVE! This time of year love as hard as you can, spread light where u see it dark, help a friend in need, hug those still around in your family tight! We only get 1 life to make this impact in our society and communities. In closing happy holidays to you and your family! 

God bless everyone,
