As this year approaches the end, so does my  term of service as Venerable Master of our Lodge.  I have been on this journey for a few years so it will be an odd feeling once it is over.  Coming up through the Council of Kadosh and then through the Lodge of Perfection has been a great experience, and as an extra bonus  my bacon cooking skills have really improved! 😊  Thank you for the opportunity to serve as the Venerable Master this past year and Thank you for all your friendship and support.

The key to success is teamwork!  The Lodge needs a strong group of committed Brothers to make things happen.  A big Thank you to Illustrious Frankie Rosario 33° for all his great advice, friendship, and leadership.  You always inspire me to be a better person.  Honorable Jamie Hopkins 32° KCCH is a driving force in our Lodge that keeps so many things moving.  The more I get to work with Jamie the more I enjoy our time together.  Honorable James Olivier 32° KCCH is also a vital part of the team and a very strong leader.  He has come through for me so many times.  Illustrious Ralph Shelton 33° has helped me to understand my role and responsibilities and how to do things the  Scottish “Rite”  way.  He is a treasure trove of masonic knowledge.  The Line of Officers have all been great and have helped to make this year fun.  Brother Todd Herschberg, Thank you for putting on a great Super Breakfast!

All good things must  come to an end, and now it will be someone else’s turn to be the Venerable Master.  I will be sitting in the gallery but I am ready to provide as much support to our Lodge as possible. 

Sincerely,
