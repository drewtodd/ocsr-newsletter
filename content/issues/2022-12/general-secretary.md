Brethren: The Holiday Season is upon us. By now, every member should have received a dues notice. Many have already been paid and we thank you. If you didn’t receive a notice or have any questions regarding your membership status, please contact me via email or phone. Please attend our next Reunion which will be held on April 21st and April 22nd at the DeMolay Center. This will be an exciting event as this is the first time we are holding our own Reunion at Anaheim since before the pandemic. Hopefully, everyone will make an effort to come out for one day and see a few degrees. Also, you will be showing your support for our newest Brothers.
 
Our Installation of new officers will be on Saturday, January 14th. You will receive an email this month with full information. Installation is one of the finest ceremonies in the Scottish Rite. And, you are welcome to bring family and friends to this event. If you know Blue Lodge Brothers who are considering joining our Valley, inviting them to our Installation Ceremony is a great introduction to the Rite.

Our Stated Meeting for December is on December 4th at 6:30 pm at the DeMolay Center. Dinner will be at  7 pm following the meeting. If you have ideas about our Valley adding new programs or any changes you would like to see, please attend the meeting and have your voice heard.

Finally, may you and your family have an outstanding Holiday!
 
Fraternally,
