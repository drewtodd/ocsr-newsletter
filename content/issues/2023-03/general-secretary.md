Brethren: March is a great time to reestablish your connection with your Valley of Orange County. Our Stated Meeting is on March 6th at 6:30 pm and will be followed by a hearty dinner. If you haven't attended our Stated Meeting lately, we think you will find it both short and informative. Judging by increased attendance at the February meeting, many Brothers agree. Our Spring Reunion is coming up soon on April 21st and April 22nd. Come by to see a degree. You will be supporting our degree teams and welcoming our new members. 

The theme of this month's newsletter is Loyalty. As Masons, loyalty is a highly-regarded attribute. But, how do we express our loyalty to our Valley and the Craft? Certainly, attendance at Stated Meetings & Reunions is one way. Participation in our special Valley fundraisers, the Super Breakfasts, is another good way. Our Spring Super Breakfast will be on Sunday, May 7th. This event offers a cornucopia of tasty, breakfast food including omelets, bacon, waffles and hash browns. Tickets will be in the mail soon. Consider volunteering to help on Sunday. Finding good candidates to join our Valley at the next Reunion is an outstanding expression of fraternal loyalty. The Valley of Orange County has a superb Masonic education program. Our AASR Master Craftsmen program is now available entirely online. Learning more about our degrees, symbolic meanings & traditions is another form of loyalty. 

Finally, let the Valley office know if you are aware of any Brother who is in sickness or distress. If you have any questions about your membership or any upcoming Valley events, please contact the Secretary at our Valley office. Have a great March. 

Fraternally,
