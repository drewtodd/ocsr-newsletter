Our California Scottish Rite Foundation held its annual meeting on November 18 and 19 at the Pasadena Scottish Rite Cathedral. A great deal of information was shared regarding the new branding and marketing for the Foundation, which will also be a part of the public face of Freemasonry in California. 

Our Valley was ably represented by Todd Hirschberg, David Frias and PR Frankie Rosario, who will be sharing more information with the Valley as the new year progresses, and you'll begin to see some of the marketing collatery roll out as well.

The Foundation is presently consolidating the administrative functions of running a center at the Orient level, resulting in significant cost savings to each center, and allowing our local center board to do what it does best - focus on the work of serving the children of Orange County in partnership with Chapman University.

Many thanks to the Valley and all of the brethren for supporting our center. Your contributions are so important in changing the lives of the children and families we serve.

S&F,
