Welcome to the Rite Childhood Language Center of Orange County! This February has proven to be a beautiful and exciting time for the children who attend our Language Center to grow and learn. Several new children have enrolled in the clinic which has given the student clinicians some very unique opportunities to develop and apply their new skills with a wide variety of kids. 

Additionally, we have been able to work collaboratively with a variety of other professionals, parents, and some professors at Chapman University to help provide the best care for each of our kids.

It is exciting to witness the amount of energy the new student clinicians bring to the clinic, and even more exhilarating to see them grow as professionals. Our current 2nd year graduate student clinicians are anxiously looking forward to their upcoming graduation at the end of the term. We are so proud of the work they have done and look forward to seeing them continue on to become independent clinicians and help many more people gain the Gift of Voice. 

The skill and expertise that is gained while working in our Language Center is truly invaluable. Student clinicians are constantly challenged, have to think outside the box and get out of their comfort zones. As a result, they acquire feelings of competence and ability that will benefit them as they progress in their on careers in the future.

The children have also been working hard. In fact, we have had TWO kids (brother and sister), already graduate from our program! Student clinicians were able to help both of these kids achieve their goals successfully during their time with us. We have also seen many children reach current goals and begin work towards the next round of their new goals. Words cannot express the wonderful feeling of watching a child go from being shy, barely speaking, and sometimes even crying during their session, to one who runs in with a smile, says hello to everyone and “ chats up” everyone in the clinic. These are the moments that make our hearts so very full! 

Finally, we are thrilled to extend a warm WELCOME to our newest supervisor, Kendra. She was added to our team this trimester. We are so fortunate to have the expertise she brings onboard to our clinic. We look forward to having her as the newest member of our team!

Sincerely,
