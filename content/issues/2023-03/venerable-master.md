Greetings brothers. Continuing on my journey to illuminate the works and thoughts of The Stoics, I'm including a quick overview of the most significant minds in the 2,000+ years of Stoic thought.

This month, I'll start at the beginning with the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy: Zeno of Citium.

## Zeno of Citium: The Seed of Stoicism

Zeno of Citium the founder of the Stoic school of philosophy. Born in 335 BCE on the island of Cyprus, Zeno was a merchant by trade before he turned to philosophy. After losing all of his wealth in a shipwreck, he studied under the philosopher Crates of Thebes and later founded his own school in Athens.

The Stoics, of whom Zeno was the founder, believed in:

- Living in accordance with nature
- Accepting what they could not change
- Practicing self-control, dignity, and wisdom
  
They believed that the path to happiness lay in **following reason**, and that by **accepting what fate brings**, we can learn to be content and live a virtuous life.

Zeno’s philosophy has been relevant for over two thousand years and his teachings continue to be studied and practiced by people from all walks of life, including Scottish Rite Masons: A philosophy that includes the pursuit of knowledge and wisdom, the practice of virtue, and the betterment of humanity.

> “The goal of life is living in agreement with nature.”

This quote speaks to the Stoic belief in living in harmony with the natural world and accepting what we cannot change. It also ties in with the Masonic value of being in tune with the universe and working towards the greater good.

> “He is a wise man who does not grieve for the things which he has not, but rejoices for those which he has.”

In other words: Be content with what you have and without dwelling on what you don't. It aligns with the Masonic idea of being grateful for what we have and using our blessings to help others.

> “Virtue consists in a will that is in agreement with natural law.”

Much like Masons, the Stoics believed that true wisdom and virtue come from following **reason** and **natural law**. In doing so, the brother can attain wisdom to guide his actions and make a positive impact on the world.

Zeno of Citium was a philosopher ahead of his time, and his teachings continue to be relevant today. The Stoic philosophy of living in accordance with nature, accepting what we cannot change, and practicing self-control, dignity, and wisdom aligns well with the values of Freemasonry. By studying and practicing the teachings of Zeno and the Stoics, we can strive to live a virtuous and fulfilling life, in accordance with nature and the universe.

Though Zeno's influence is undeniable, he is one of the more obscure Stoic philosophers for the simple reason that none of his teachings survived in writing. After his death, his students passed down his philosophy for a couple of generations before any meaningful writings were created.

Next month we'll continue with the man who is credited with getting Stoic thought into writing:  **Seneca**.

Until then, brothers, be well.
