## Traits of Good Stewardship In Scripture 

The role of steward was common during biblical times and is often used as an example of the Christian’s relationship to God. That is, everything belongs to God and we are to manage it and treat it not as our own, but as His.

Good stewardship isn’t just about money. It’s an orientation toward God that presumes certain character traits and attitudes toward His resources.

### Trustworthiness
*1 Corinthians 4:1-2 NIV*  
”This, then, is how you ought to regard us: as servants of Christ and as those entrusted with the mysteries God has revealed. Now it is required that those who have been given a trust must prove faithful.”

### Gratitude and Respect
*Deuteronomy 8:17-18*  
You may say to yourself, “My power and the strength of my hands have produced this wealth for me.” But remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you the ability to produce wealth, and so confirms his covenant, which he swore to your ancestors, as it is today.”

### Care of Others
*Acts 20:35 NIV*  
“In everything I did, I showed you that by this kind of hard work we must help the weak, remembering the words the Lord Jesus himself said: ‘It is more blessed to give than to receive.’ ”

### Focus on Sprituality
*1 Timothy 4:14 NIV*  
“Do not neglect your gift, which was given you through prophecy when the body of elders laid their hands on you.”

*1 Peter 4:10-11 NIV*  
“Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God’s grace in its various forms. If anyone speaks, they should do so as one who speaks the very words of God. If anyone serves, they should do so with the strength God provides, so that in all things God may be praised through Jesus Christ. To him be the glory and the power for ever and ever. Amen.”

### Good Stewardship Is a Way of Life
As you can see “good stewardship” is a way of life that honors God and all those we come in contact with or are charged with caring for. While it includes giving of our means to God, that is just one aspect of how we steward our money and other resources.
