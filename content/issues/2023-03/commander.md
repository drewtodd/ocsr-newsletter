## 666 and the 19th Degree

The 19th Degree is called Grand Pontiff, and the word pontiff comes from the Latin words that mean “bridge.” This is an apt name for this degree as it acts as a bridge between the 18 degrees that have come before and the remaining degrees that come after. This degree is a demarcation point where the degrees start to become more advanced. The 19th degree has a structure reminiscent of the third degree, where there is a part where you think the degree is over, but in actuality, it is just getting started. That moment in the 19th degree occurs when the mysterious number 666 is brought up. One thing that is unique about this degree compared to any of the degrees that come before, or even after for that matter, is that the candidate needs to listen very carefully to the first question that is posed. After 18 prior degrees of simple “yes” or “I do” answers, the candidate finally has to stop and think about how he answers the question regarding 666 and “the Beast.”

The number 666 has comically come to be associated in our modern age with devils, goblins, and witches. That association came later in history with campaigns of the Roman Catholic Church. In the Apocalypse of St. John (or Book of Revelation), the book from which these symbols come from, the first century audience would have been able to decipher the number 666 and understood that all the vivid imagery would have been symbolic forms of political commentary. 

There have been many possibilities offered as to the real meaning of 666. It was supposed to be an encrypted message, so it makes sense that there is no definitive answer. The most likely explanation is that it was a code for Nero, the emperor of Rome at the time. People at this time were familiar with something called gematria, which is where letters in the alphabet have numerical equivalents. This was common in Hebrew and also existed in Greek, the language in which the Apocalypse was written. If you take the numbers that would correlate with the letters in “Nero Caesar,” they add up to 666. It makes sense that the author would speak in a coded message this way because Nero burned Christians alive. It would be a death warrant to put his name in writing, so a code made more sense. Even the tone in which this passage is written begs the reader to solve a riddle. “Let the person who has insight calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man. That number is 666.”

The Book of Revelation has a tone that is unlike many other books in the Bible, especially the books of the New Testament. It is one of those books that the final editors of the Bible probably let slip through the cracks and I think would probably take out if they had another chance, similar to how other books like the Book of Enoch or The Gospel of Mary didn’t make the final cut because they didn’t fit the narrative the editors were trying to achieve. As Albert Pike says in Morals and Dogma, “The Apocalypse, indeed, is a book as obscure as the Sohar. It is written hieroglyphically with numbers and images; and the Apostle often appeals to the intelligence of the Initiated. ‘Let him who hath knowledge, understand! Let him who understands, calculate!’ (Revelation 13:18) he often says, after an allegory or mention of a number. Saint John, the favorite Apostle, and the Depository of all the Secrets of the Savior, therefore did not write to be understood by the multitude.” 

Here Pike affirms that The Book of Revelation with its mysterious numbers and symbols was never meant for mass consumption because its symbols would be misinterpreted. It’s also interesting to note that although the exact authorship of the Apocalypse is disputed, Pike associates it with St. John the Apostle and also says that Jesus’s secrets were passed on to John. Pike goes on with another interesting quote saying that the Apocalypse is the complete embodiment of the occult.

“The Sephar Yezirah, the Sohar, and the Apocalypse are the completest embodiments of Occultism. They contain more meanings than words; their expressions are figurative as poetry and exact as numbers. The Apocalypse sums up, completes, and surpasses all the Science of Abraham and of Solomon. The visions of Ezekiel, by the river Chebar, and of the new Symbolic Temple, are equally mysterious expressions, veiled by figures of the enigmatic dogmas of the Kabbalah, and their symbols are as little understood by the Commentators, as those of Freemasonry.”

The footnote in the annotated version of Morals and Dogma says the occult encompasses magic, alchemy, and Theosophy. The connection between Abraham, Solomon, and the Apocalypse is actually explained back in the third degree chapter of M&D:

“The Holy Kabbalah, or tradition of the children of Seth, was carried from Chaldæa by Abraham, taught to the Egyptian priesthood by Joseph, recovered and purified by Moses, concealed under symbols in the Bible, revealed by the Saviour to Saint John, and contained, entire, under hieratic figures analogous to those of all antiquity, in the Apocalypse of that Apostle.”

We see that 666 is just one of the last in a long line of symbols and numbers going all the way back to Seth and Abraham. Our job as Scottish Rite Freemasons is to do the hard work to decipher the deeper meanings of these symbols and to not be content with simplistic, exoteric interpretations.

Until next month, brothers...
