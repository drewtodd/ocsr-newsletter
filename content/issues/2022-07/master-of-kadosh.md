Independence. Self worth. Self love. Self reflection. A Lover. Then Harmony. All these are very important accolades we all as humans should strive to attain or endeavor. It’s funny because in order for us to Love someone truly we must learn to take good care and condition ourselves to this experience of “love.” So it’s very important to take time on ourselves learn ourselves and try to follow the Rite steps in achieving a certain level of fulfillment or growth in our spiritual path. So much fulfillment that you are feeling overwhelmed or complete! Feeling joy because the dedication and commitment to the well being of your spirit is paying off. Hence feeling charged and ready to pour evolved energy into a woman or child to begin a legacy. 

Independence is valuable because it’s only going to be you facing death one day. No one else is going to experience that but you. So it’s important to learn how it feels like to lie down on a bed, when you’re sad, cry and pick yourself back up again, over and over. You’re programming your soul to continue on and be strong, keep trying. Relive or be reborn out into the world. 

On our path of independence we find out a deep connection with the universe and life itself. We come to find out that we need one another’s help support and effort. Because who wants to talk to themselves? Haha I sure don’t. We will realize that we’re all just a building block of energy here to add to our communities and society. Give back to mother earth, and raise children that spread that SAME message and truest wisdom that comes with Self Attainment, independence and Love!  

Fraternally,
