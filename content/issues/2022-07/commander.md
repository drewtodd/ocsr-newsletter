If we, as human beings, are all descended from a primordial ancestor who lived in the treetops, then independence is baked into our genes - as it is a difficult thing to hold committee meetings on a branch, assuming you can even get a quorum.

On the other hand, sitting out on a branch, casually munching on caterpillars under the African sun and watching the gazelle gallop across the savannah, gives one plenty of time to think.  And I must assume that one of those thoughts must have been "You know what?  Caterpillars taste horrible. I'd much rather be eating gazelle."

I'm sure that a few of these primitive ancestors of ours, filled with the pride of his independence and sick of caterpillars, must have wandered out onto the plains to catch himself a gazelle... only to be quickly eaten by a lion.

Eventually some hominid, slightly smarter than his peers, would have invited a few others to join him on his branch.  "Look," he must have grunted, "I'm sure you're all as tired of caterpillar sashimi as I am. One lone hunter is no match for the perils outside of the jungle... but by trading some small portion of our independence for the security of a group we can all venture forth, fend off the predators, and grab ourselves some tasty antelope tartar.  All in favor, grunt 'Aye'"  (The fire sub-committee had yet to be established, hence antelope tartar).

This intrepid group must have then ventured forth. Lions, not being completely stupid, would have avoided the group and sought easier prey. Gazelles, being a bit dumber than lions, would have been surrounded and poked with sharp sticks until they became food.

This group then realized that not only was venison tastier than butterfly larva, it was higher in yummy calories and tasty fats... which of course meant that eventually they moved out of the trees (the third or fourth time your branch breaks because you weigh too much is usually a sign to even the dimmest primate).  

They also learned that that female with the really pretty fur would rather hang out with the gazelle gourmands than the grub club... and that they could trade a juicy venison steak (once the fire sub-committee had ratified the use of fire for cooking purposes by a two-thirds majority) for an original Og handprint on their cave's living room wall (which seriously impressed the smoking hot cro magnon chick with the red hair).

The moral of this little tale?

"The independent primate catches the worm, but the cooperative ones eat MUCH better"  (I never claimed to be Aesop)
