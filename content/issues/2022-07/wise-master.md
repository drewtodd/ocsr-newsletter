Greetings Brethren,

May your Independence Day celebrations be hotter than a thousand Julys. My personal favorite holiday where families can come together in the sun, party, and appreciate the founding of our great Republic.

The 17th degree or Knight of the East & West is extremely robust. I would imagine the setting up and decorating the Preceptory must be a daunting effort alone.  Colored columns supporting lamps are organized in the form of a heptagon with the Hebrew initials of the names of the last seven sephiroth of the Kabbalah. Twenty-four armchairs surrounding the room decorated according to their respective stations pointing towards a platform of seven steps guarded by winged oxen which also supports a violet altar. Why such drama?

In the first section of this Degree, we witness the pride of King Herod condemning him as he shamefully murders John the Baptist for calling him out on his own ugly and sinful lust. The great contest between good and evil, anticipating the return of our great redeemer, the mysterious esoteric teachings of the Essenes as well as the Cabalists are symbolized and taught by John the Baptist. From the Essenes, we glimpse our ancient writers whose knowledge’s influence extended to Asia Minor, Ephesus, and Alexandria. Hence, we are called Knights of the East and West, because their doctrines came from both. Looking again to The Road Less Traveled [Sekera] we learn, “And with these doctrines, the wheat sifted from the chaff, the Truth separated from Error, Masonry has garnered up in her heart of hearts, and through the fires of persecution, and the storms of calamity, has brought them and delivered them unto us. These, rejecting all the wild and useless speculations of the Zend-Avesta, Kabbalah, Gnostics, and the Schools, are the religion and Philosophy of Masonry.”

In our calls to the Almoner, remember Brethren: He who giveth to charity, lendeth to the Lord.

Sincerely & Fraternally,
