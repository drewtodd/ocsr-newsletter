I’d like to express my thanks again to the heads of body for contributing their excellent and thoughtful articles this month and for doing so in a timely fashion.

## Calling All Writers!

You don’t have to be a head of body or a member of the line to contribute to this newsletter! If you have something to say from a masonic perspective — perhaps insights into your masonic ruminations, scholarly endeavors you’d like to share, or general news for the brethren — this newsletter is your conduit for those ideas. I encourage any and all brothers who’d like to contribute something to this newsletter to send their ideas to:

**[editor@ocscottishrite.org](mailto:editor@ocscottishrite.org)**

I’ll work with you on getting your article together for the next issue.

## Quick Tip - Printing this Newsletter

Did you know that you can save this newsletter as a PDF, creating a version suitable for saving, emailing, or printing on 8.5 x 11" paper? It's a pretty straightforward process:

1. Open the Newsletter in your PC browser and Print it (File > Print or Ctrl-P)
2. Select "Save as PDF" instead of a printer
3. Set the scale to 65%
4. Uncheck "Headers and footers"
5. Click "Save"

That's it!

I'll continute to work on refining this process, but this should at least get you what you need for now.

Fraternally,
