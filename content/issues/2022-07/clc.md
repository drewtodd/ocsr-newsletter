Welcome back to the RiteCare Childhood Language Center of Orange County. It is hard to believe that our Summer session is over in June? 

Well, at the RiteCareCLC in Orange County it is! And what a summer it was! We packed the magic of summer into 7 weeks for our shortened trimester. Bathed our in our Beach Theme, we even had “The Old Lady Who Swallowed a shell, crab, a pail, fish, shark, whale, sand, and wave – you get the picture! The kids loved working to feed this Little Old Lady.

It is always difficult to say goodbye to the children as we become attached, but it is exceptionally gratifying when the children graduate. Mushashi worked hard for us for 2 years and is now ready to transition into Kindergarten. His previous supervisor, Leah, who was not at the Center this trimester, joined us via Zoom at the end of his session. You can see their delight in seeing each other again. Mushashi really wanted Leah to have a piece of chocolate he brought as a thank you gift.

Ethan is also transitioning into Kindergarten. His supervisor, Francine and intern, Donna were very excited to see him graduate too! His little brother was delighted to get a cookie. And, we are not only say goodbye to our little darlings, but to each other too. This set of interns have graduated and are taking flight into the real working world with jobs. The CLC will open again on September 6 and we will be making new friends.
