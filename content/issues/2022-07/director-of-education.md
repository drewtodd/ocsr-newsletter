## In sterquiliniis invenitur

I once had an opportunity (during my undergraduate studies at UCI) to conduct a deep dive into the many psychoanalysts throughout history. I was fascinated by all, save one; Carl Jung. Having a younger, more scientifically-bound mind, I was swooned by the lure and provocation of stringent clinical methodology, variant analyses, and well-documented, mainstream data of the fractured mind, all positively correlated with psychological, sociological, biological, and neurological origins. I had an indifference to anything introducing religion into the mix, as it couldn’t be a definitively expressed variable. At the time, Carl Jung ostensibly was the only psychoanalyst facilitating the construct of G-d, religion, or spirituality into his theory. I was hard-set on the “fact-based” evidence, without the prospect of Deity, without truly concerning the implications of a spiritual constitution… but this would change due to Freemasonry.

Over the past decade, I have profoundly enjoyed delving into the vastness of Esotericism, whether it be Kabbalah, Rosicrucianism, Hermeticism, ancient cultures, or World religions in the hopes of examining that perennial philosophy, the resolution of the Human Condition, that address to the inquiry posed… “What is the meaning of life?” or better, “what does it mean to truly be alive?” 

During my time in New Mexico, I had the opportunity to lose and find myself anew in the Chihuahuan and High Deserts. I’d fallen down the rabbit-hole of Shamanism & Taoism while the Elders of the Sandia Pueblo Tribe ushered me on a personal journey to penetrate the veil by which I had been bound. Those experiences have introduced me to a relationship with Creator I could have never imagined. A purity of purpose, and an exfoliation of self-torment. Many Holy Writings reveal similar stories of those “lost in the desert” and being inspired by the Great Architect of the Universe for vision and purpose. 

Through many trials and tribulations, I have concluded much, but particularly that this Earthly-experience seems to define our salvation (or evolution) through suffering, or in Buddhism, the struggle of which to overcome the inevitable. Call them the “Hero’s Journey,” or the “Surrender to His Will,” whatever… they are all calls-to-action. These may be overwhelming, or perhaps at the moment, all seems within balance and at peace with little resistance. I then ask you to create chaos once again, manifesting this struggle by stepping-out of your comfort zone and challenging yourself, especially if you are busy, especially if you have excuses not to. Esoterism is spread across many disciplines and schools of thought. There are answers to life that you don’t know you don’t know. Take for example the English alphabet having 26 letters, whereas the Russian alphabet has 36. In essence, the Russian language has words and expressions that we do not even have. Imagine their literature, their poetry. Investigating content which you have not been exposed to will reveal a profound treasure. There is a great world that lies within our beautiful Scottish Rite philosophy alone.  

Is the key, actually to suffer? Is it the grind; the struggle that liberates us? Is it true that we do find the light in the deepest depths of total Darkness? Let us endeavor, that in a world filled with chaos and destruction, we forge the strength to explore within and manifest without: Sicut in caelo et en terra!  

## Save the date!

On **Saturday, August 27th from 8am-3pm** at the DeMolay Center, we will be hosting a Scottish Rite classroom instruction for those degrees not communicated at the last 2 Long Beach Scottish Rite Reunions. Snacks, Drinks, and a lunch will be provided. This is only open to Orange County Scottish Rite members who are 32° MsRS. An RSVP to Bro. Andrew Todd, our General Secretary, or myself is required no later than Monday, August 22nd. This event is FREE but RSVP is necessary to confirm all brothers are fed. 

Moving forward OCSR will either be providing this experience during our “at home” reunions at the DeMolay Center, or on a separate date following a joint reunion with other Valleys. This is to ensure that our OCSR brethren are receiving the optimal level of masonic experience and education per Supreme Council’s vision. It is at this meeting that I will be going into greater detail regarding the Master Craftsman Program and potential formation of the ASRITE Society.
