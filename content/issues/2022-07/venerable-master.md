## Independence = Freedom

Happy Independence Day to everyone!  I hope you took time to reflect on the precious gift of freedom that we enjoy in this country.  Our freedom is special and something we should always celebrate.  Many people have sacrificed so much for us to be free. 

One benefit of independence and freedom is that we can all freely share our opinions about why our country is great and where we need to improve.  You have the right to form your opinion and express your views.

In my opinion our country is great at celebrating our freedom but not always great at demonstrating our freedom.  The best way to demonstrate your freedom is to vote.  It is great to express your opinion and it is even greater to cast your vote.  I don’t care how you vote or what party affiliation you prefer but I care about the low voter rate.  Our Democracy needs everyone to vote so we can protect our freedom.  So maybe the formula above should be:

> Independence = **Active** Freedom

At the beginning of the year I shared my New Year resolutions for 2022.  Since we are at the half way point lets see how I’m doing.

- **Be Early** - instead of procrastinating on everything try and get things done early.  For example get my article written early instead of always turning it in late. *Update:  This one needs more work!  I’m still more late than early.*
- **Be Present** - Try to focus more on the people I’m with instead of always being distracted.  It is too easy to look at my dam phone instead of trying to have a good conversation. *Update:  Still 50/50 on this one.  I will keep trying.*
- **Exercise More** - This past year I did better about getting some exercise. This new year I need to be more regular about moving my body so I can stay healthy. *Update:  I’m definitely making improvements with my exercise activity.  Currently I’m on a 61 day streak of meeting my move/activity goal and have lost about 10 pounds.*
- **Learn something New** - It would be great to learn a second language.  I’ve dabbled with learning Spanish almost my whole life.  I need to get beyond the basic survival skills of ordering a beer and asking for the bathroom. Update: Still need to learn something new.
- **Learn to play golf** - This one is for my wife.  She retired this year and is eagerly learning to play golf.  This would be something fun for us to do together. *Update:  I’m back on the golf course with my wife and we enjoy playing golf on the weekend about twice a month at our favorite local course.  We are having more fun together and enjoying being outside away from the screen.*
- **Eat more Leafy vegetables** -  Another one my wife would like but basically less bacon and more green veggies. *Update - I’m killing this one.  I have worked on my diet to include more vegetables and have at least one salad just about every day.*

I look forward to seeing you all at our July Stated Meeting on Monday the 11th.

Fraternally,
