Brethren: In early June, we held an outstanding Spring Reunion with the Valley of Long Beach. We initiated 6 new members in to the Valley of Orange County. These new Brothers are interested and enthusiastic about participating in our Rite. With the worst of the pandemic behind us, we are seeing more Blue Lodge Brothers show an interest in joining the AASR. With the resumption of in-person Stated Meetings, now is an ideal time to make sure that your Blue Lodge Brothers are aware of our Orange County Valley.

The theme of this newsletter is independence which is most appropriate as we will be celebrating American Independence Day on the 4th. This concept of independence is central to our fraternity. Masonic organizations have independent bodies that ensure that we practice and adhere to the principles, standards & rituals of Freemasonry. Beyond this, our Valleys and Lodges vote upon and make important decisions at the Lodge level. Matters of new members, budgets and spending and community outreach programs are all decided independently by the members of the concerned Lodge. Every Brother shares in the responsibility of the well-being of his Lodge. This is true independence. 

Due to the first Monday in July falling on the 4th holiday, we will be holding our Stated Meeting on Monday, July 11th at 6:30 pm at the DeMolay Center in Anaheim. We look forward to seeing you there. As always, please let the office know if you are aware of a Brother who is ill or in distress. Have an excellent summer. 

Fraternally,
