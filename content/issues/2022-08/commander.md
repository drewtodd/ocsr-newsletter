So... A Jew, a Catholic, a Muslim, a Lutheran, a Buddhist, a Mormon, and a Methodist walk into a Lodge.  The end. No punchline needed.  This is what I love about our Fraternity.

It has been said that when people join clubs as simple as a fraternity, it's just - you want to be in a group. You want to be around people, you want to be with people.  That is the fundamental difference between a fraternity and our Fraternity.

Yes, in our Fraternity we get to be WITH people and AROUND people - but, in a larger sense, our Brotherhood helps us to BE with people. College fraternities seek conformity, they want the pledges to think alike - to go along to get along. Our Fraternity encourages us to be unique, thoughtful individuals - and helps us to grow as human beings by helping us recognize the commonalities that unite us as a true Brotherhood, while acknowledging that it is the differences that make us human.

Our Fraternity is made of people who have joined for as many reasons as there are members:  some have joined because their father or grandfather was a Mason, some have joined for the sense of history, some for the ritual, some for the esoterica, some because they saw a show or movie that piqued their interest, some for the charitable giving, some for the sense of Brotherhood that was missing in their life.  That being said, our Fraternity is not one that can be casually joined, so there is a common thread that we all share - the desire to be better husbands, better fathers, better sons. better citizens, better men, better human beings.

My story: I joined because of the Childhood Language Centers.  I had a speech impediment as a child.  I was fortunate in that I was able to receive the help I needed through my school, so I know what a huge difference it made in my life.  As the cause is near and dear to my heart, I saw in Scottish Rite Freemasonry the opportunity to help kids not as fortunate as I was.  I have now had the privilege of sitting on several CLC Boards throughout the state of California. 

If you have not done so lately, do yourself a favor: turn to your Brothers in the Fraternity - ask them a simple question: Why are you a Mason? Share your story, you may find that you joined for similar reasons, but you may also find new reasons to love this Fraternity of ours.
