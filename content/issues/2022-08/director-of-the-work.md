Over a decade ago I sat in a room… waiting. Nervous. 

I heard the gavels rap as Lodge was opened. I knew not what was to come. The Tyler at the time at my home Lodge gave me a pat on the shoulder and told me “Don’t worry… every person in that room has gone through everything you’re about to experience.” It was reassuring, but didn’t allay my fears one bit. 

But then it happened… I was properly prepared and led into the room for my initiation of my own freewill and accord. Truly one of the most wonderful experiences of my life. In those moments, the fear of the unknown faded away. I was on a path that was going to lead me down a rabbit hole of knowledge I never thought possible. We say in Freemasonry that we take good men and make them better. I would even argue that we take the willing whom have the inner desire to improve, and give them the tools by which they can become the best versions of themselves.

Over the last few months, we’ve held a joint reunion with our Brethren of the Valley of Long Beach, bringing more new members into our ranks. In a few months, we’re coming back home to the Demolay Center to hold our own reunion (with, I hope, the help from Long Beach as well). 

The biggest point is this… shared experience. As a themed entertainment designer, I try in all of my projects to imbue some kind of shared experience among the guests that might walk through something I’ve done. Something that at the end of the day they can all high-five and say “Yeah, that’s cool!” Freemasonry is my “Yeah, that’s cool!” moment. We’ve all gone through the same experiences of the Blue Lodges, we’ve all gone through the same experience of a Scottish Rite Reunion. And though our ritual might have changed over the centuries, the experience itself is largely the same. I don’t get precious about many things, but when it comes to Freemasonry… I get precious. 

It is a gift to us all from those who came before. It is something to be cherished and protected. As I tell anyone who will listen… I truly and sincerely believe in the lessons we teach, I do believe that when applied to one’s own conduct of life and character, you do become a better person. This beautiful and gentle craft is a wonderful thing. If you’re reading this, you’ve come through a huge amount of degree content, both in the Blue Lodges and in the Scottish Rite. Don’t stop here. Keep striving, keep learning. Stay hungry for knowledge and wisdom… because they only reveal themselves to those who truly seek them.

Also, never forget those unique moments. The initiation, passing and raising… the moments of your Scottish Rite reunion, making new friends. Personally, I think fondly of the time that Hon. Hopkins, Hon. McCallion and I spent that first weekend together receiving our Scottish Rite degrees over 10 years ago now! This is a lifetime journey, and we’re all in it together. We’re here to learn and grow as men and Masons. That is the strength and basis of our Fraternity. To be the best versions of ourselves that we can possibly become. I am truly blessed to be surrounded by a group of outstanding humans who do the best they can everyday to exemplify those virtues. Thank you for being my Brother.

Sincerely and Fraternally,
