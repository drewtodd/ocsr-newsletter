Brethren: Hope you are enjoying the summer. We held an excellent, Stated Meeting on July 11th. Two of our newly initiated Brothers, Daniel Toppish 32째 and Andre Rodriguez 32째, were present and welcomed by the Brethren. The meeting was followed by a very tasty meal of chicken, beans, rice & tortillas. We will be holding our August Stated Meeting on Monday, August 3rd at 6:30 pm at the DeMolay Center. Our Sovereign Grand Inspector General for the Orient of California, Illustrious Frank Loui 33째, will be in attendance. A fine will be served afterward. Try to let the Valley office know if you plan on attending so we can have an accurate dinner count. 

Our Supreme Office and our Valley have programs in place to bring back Brothers who may have fallen behind in dues. If you know of a Brother who may have been suspended for non-payment of dues (or be a few years behind in dues payments), please contact the Valley office. We will reach out to him. This program allows a Brother who may owe several years of back dues to reactivate his dues at a favorable cost. The only requirement is for a Brother to be current and in good standing with his Blue Lodge. 

Tickets and information for our Fall Super Breakfast fundraiser in September will be mailed out this month. This is the only fundraiser we hold purely for support of our Valley. Your support of this event is greatly appreciated. Finally, our Fall Reunion is coming up in November. We are always looking for good candidates. Please speak to your worth Lodge Brothers about the Orange County Scottish Rite. We thank our members who have been bringing in petitions (particularly from Saddleback Laguna and Yorba Linda Lodges). 

Fraternally,
