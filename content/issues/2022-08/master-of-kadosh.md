Greetings Brethren, 

The first fraternal structure was established and began in the 17-1800s.  Phi Beta Kappa, was first in North America to incorporate most of the elements of modern fraternities founded at the College of William and Mary in 1775. In 1779, Phi Beta Kappa expanded to include chapters at Harvard and Yale. By the early 19th century, the organization transformed itself into a scholastic honor society and abandoned secrecy.  If you haven’t already you can research the many many chapters of Greek 

Fraternities in our country that came from this establishment that I can not list here for the purpose of typing space and time. Many Greek fraternities are now still recruiting, teaching, and practicing great domestic moral and social duties but have focused on initiating members who fall into a certain category of study like Engineering, Agriculture, Business, Medicine Government, and Music. With a few exceptions, most fraternities and sororities are secret societies. While the identity of members or officers is rarely concealed, fraternities and sororities initiate members following the pledge period through sometimes elaborate private rituals, frequently drawn or adopted from Masonic ritual practice or that of the Greek mysteries. Fraternities represent the intersection between dining clubs, literary societies and secret initiatory orders such as Freemasonry. Since 1900, 63 percent of members of the United States cabinet have been members of fraternities and sororities, and the current chief executive officers of five of the ten largest Fortune 500 companies are members of fraternities and sororities. In addition, 85 percent of all justices of the U.S. Supreme Court since 1910 have been members of fraternities. U.S. presidents since World War II who have been initiated into fraternities are George W. Bush, George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton, Ronald Reagan, Gerald Ford, and Franklin Roosevelt. Three Prime Ministers of Canada have also been members of fraternities. Being a member of this ancient fraternity of ours has been a privilege to many, but also has raised many leaders by promoting great character and friendship that has done great things for society. I hope all brothers new and old continue to practice the lessons taught and motivate younger boys to take part in a fraternal experience. This will help mold them into being a better member of the greater universal fraternity which is humanity.
