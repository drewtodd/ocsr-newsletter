## Fraternity
Greetings, brothers. We use the word _fraternity_ quite a bit within our ranks; representing the group that we are, and also the the feeling of brotherliness. It’s a big part of what brings us together in Masonry.

When asked by non-masons about the Scottish Rite of Freemasonry, I often explain it as two-things: A social organization with a particular focus on educating fellow Master Masons on the traditions, philosophy, and symbolism of the Craft. Less a “college of Freemasonry” and more a “deep dive” into masonry.

Fraternity defined covers both angles:

> *fraternity (noun): fra-ter-ni-ty | \ frə-ˈtər-nə-tē \*  
> *1. a group of people associated or formally organized for a common purpose, interest, or pleasure*  
> *2. the quality or state of being brothers : BROTHERLINESS*  

And if we are about bettering ourselves and deepening our understanding of the nature of things — aiming towards enlightenment — I see a paradox: Why would we afford such knowledge to only half of the population (read: men)?

I get it, I get it. It’s literally in the name: *Frater* is BROTHER in Latin! Not SIBLING (which would be *fratrem*).

My point is just, if we are a social group (not unlike the fraternities you find on college campuses), then this is fine. We’re a bunch of guys who want to get together a few times a month and hang out — away from the mothers, sisters, wives, and girlfriends. No harm there. Just some good old male bonding, but with minutes and voting and bills.

But, if the Scottish Rite is about pushing a human being towards enlightenment and a truer understand of the universe, humanity, and ourselves, why only offer such knowledge to men?

Society has changed dramatically since Albert Pike first set out the tenants of The Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry. Women’s roles have changed. My question to you is, should Freemasonry change along with it?

Interestingly, there have been women in masonry since the mid-1700s (in France). There are parallel female-only and mixed masonic groups ([The Order of Women Freemasons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_Women_Freemasons) in England, for instance, and [Freemasonry for Women Los Angeles WFMLA](https://www.wfmla.com)). But Grand Lodges don’t allow regular masons to participate in those groups’ activities. And, by extension, neither do the Southern or Northern jurisdictions of the Scottish Rite.

In the interest of fraternity, but also *égalité*, I posit the question to you, my brothers: What are your thoughts on the topic? Can you see a day when men and women enter a Lodge together, take up the study of Scottish Rite Masonry, ponder the true nature of things side-by-side, not *fraternally*, per se, but *fratremally*?

Until next time, be well, brothers.
