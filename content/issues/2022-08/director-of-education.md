## Save the date!

On **Saturday, August 27th from 8am-3pm** at the DeMolay Center, we will be hosting a Scottish Rite classroom instruction for those degrees not communicated at the last 2 Long Beach Scottish Rite Reunions. Snacks, Drinks, and a lunch will be provided. This is only open to Orange County Scottish Rite members who are 32° MsRS. An RSVP to Bro. Andrew Todd, our General Secretary, or myself is required no later than Monday, August 22nd. This event is FREE but RSVP is necessary to confirm all brothers are fed. 

Moving forward OCSR will either be providing this experience during our “at home” reunions at the DeMolay Center, or on a separate date following a joint reunion with other Valleys. This is to ensure that our OCSR brethren are receiving the optimal level of masonic experience and education per Supreme Council’s vision. It is at this meeting that I will be going into greater detail regarding the Master Craftsman Program and potential formation of the ASRITE Society.
