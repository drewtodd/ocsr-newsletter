Welcome everyone to the RiteCare Childhood Language Center of Orange County. We are fully into Summer now and during this time the Language Center is quiet. As many of you know we follow the Chapman University academic calendar so the Language Center will be dark until the beginning of September.

Over the last 10 years our Language Center has gone through a few major transformations. Going back to when Illustrious Frankie Rosario 33° was the Chairman of the Board he had the vision to dramatically change and improve the way our center operates.  Frankie worked with Dr. Judy Montgomery to craft an agreement with Chapman University so they bring their first class therapy services to our center.  Chapman already had licensed Speech Language Pathologist on staff with a very strong expertise in helping children overcome their speech and language challenges.  The formation of this partnership provided our center with the ability to help more families, provide a higher quality of therapy and simplify oversight provided by the Scottish Rite.  Now the Board of Directors and the Scottish Rite could focus on improving our fundraising efforts.  

Another transformation was moving the center from the historic house on French Street in Santa Ana to a more professional office environment at our current location on East 4th Street, still in Santa Ana.  French St had been our home for many years, and everyone was very rooted in that location.  Despite the difficulties with moving offices everyone embraced the challenge to get it done.  The new offices on 4th street are more conducive to the children responding and improving as a result of the therapy they receive from the student clinicians at Chapman University.

COVID brought us to the last major transformation, and we would not have been successful without the other changes that came before.  Our partnership with Chapman University and their deep bench of knowledge and expertise allowed us to pivot quickly to online therapy.  We continued to help families and when the time came to return to in person therapy our new office location and layout made it easier to help keep everyone separate and safe.  Throughout this difficult time Chapman University has consistently provided our Language Center with the blueprint to success.  We remain focused on helping the children in our community become great communicators.

Lastly, I wish a very fond adieu to Chris Switzer who has been with us for most of this journey.  The last three years she has served as the Manager of the clinic.  Her efforts during the move and during COVID were instrumental in keeping our doors open and keeping us on course.  I wish there was a pill I could take to match Chris’ level of commitment and her level of caring for the families that we serve.  The shoes are very big!

Thank you.
