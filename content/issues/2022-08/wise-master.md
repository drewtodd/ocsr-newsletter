Greetings Brethren,

As mentioned in our previous article, the 17th Degree is extremely robust and adorned with many symbols from ages past drawing inspiration from the New Testament. In the first section we learned about King Herod’s sinful nature resulting in the shameful murder of John the Baptist. In the second section, which we will explore here, borrows symbolism from St. John’s apocalyptic vision while exiled on the island of Patmos of a baron wasteland of lost souls. His revelation lends us insight as to why he responded, “My life, perhaps, but not my soul” to Herod’s interrogations earlier, divorcing him from total control (and hence St. John’s truth exposing the King’s egotism).

What were the roots of John’s bravery, staunch commitment to purity and incorruptible love of God? In the 1st century, John the Evangelist may be said to have written the Book of Revelation. In the second section of this degree, there are seven intonements or summaries of the wisdom found therein. In short, he that overcomes, will receive the hidden manna, power over the nations, who’s name will be marked in stone, and seated with the Father near His throne, forever. Knowing such, we can admit that John the Evangelist was a true believer of the immortal soul. Fearless from bodily harm. His zealous appeal to faith and his unwavering steadfastness to God, enabled truth casting the final verdict over his life. An act worthy of imitation.

This degree contests the great battle between good and evil, anticipating the return of our great Redeemer, using the mysterious esoteric teachings of the Essenes and the Cabalists. These teachings give us a glimpse into the old world of ancient writers who gave us the first idea of a pure and perfect life of which Jesus so beautifully embodied and St John the Evangelist advanced throughout the first centuries giving rise to the dominance of Christianity.

In our calls to the Almoner, remember Brethren: He who giveth to charity, lendeth to the Lord.

Sincerely & Franternally,

Sincerely & Fraternally,
