If you weren’t at the July Stated meeting, you missed a big event.  It was such a simple thing but significant to have a group of Scottish Rite Masons from our Valley gather to share a meal.  This is something we have missed for over two years.  Granted it was a small group of approximately 12 brothers, but this certainly represents one part of our Fraternity that I enjoy the most.  For a short time, we get to talk to each other and share the events of our life.  

So much of the last two years has been about isolation and avoiding social situations.  We need to get back together and remember how much fun it is to be with people.  Many members feel that coming to Lodge for just the Stated Meeting isn’t enough.  People want to spend time at the lodge and have a more complete experience.

One great aspect of our fraternity is the opportunity to come together and befriend someone you never expected to meet.  Men of different ages and from different backgrounds can enjoy our friendships while putting aside certain items that might keep us apart.  We have plenty of time to talk about politics and religions at home but around the lodge we focus on what unites us the most.  I hope to see you at the next stated meeting and enjoy more time at dinner after the meeting.


Fraternally,
