As we near the close of another year, we take the time to stand back and take account of all that has happened and how it has affected us as individuals and collectively as Masons of The Scottish Rite. A few short weeks ago, a reason for thankfulness came to the fore in the form of a very successful reunion class, the largest we’ve had in years. Brothers, new and old, gathered together to take in our bi-annual tradition, and it was a fun time for all involved. 

We’ve seen increased attendance at our meetings, great programs following the meetings, and more on the way! 

> “Gratitude makes sense of our past, brings peace for today, and creates a vision for tomorrow.” - Melody Beattie. 

Now, please take a moment to reflect on the year that is quickly fading into the past; as each breath becomes a memory, each action, intentionally or not, becomes our personal history. As I often say during our reunions at least once, “Every action, every choice we make in life has led us to this moment, in this place.” So now the question as you take your account of the life and the year that was (and this is for all of us)… did we leave the world, the valley, our brothers, our families, and friends better than we found them at the opening of the year? 

Take a moment to reflect on all of the choices you’ve made. What has given you reason for a sense of gratitude and thankfulness? Was it a tiny kindness shown to a stranger? A fun event with friends? Or even something as simple as enjoying the beauty of nature surrounding us? Never lose sight of these events as they fade into the past in the face of the spurious present so often filled with all of life’s stresses. In those moments, be thankful for the fortune you have in this life! 

For me? I’m thankful for my wife, my life, the adventures I’ve been afforded, the fellowship and friendship afforded me through this beautiful craft, and the simple act of waking up in the morning to face another day with the bravest face one can muster. 

It is my sincerest wish that you have a nearly unending list of reasons to be thankful in your own life and that every day brings you an opportunity to add to it! Remember to note all the little things; as insignificant as they seem at the time, they might also bring a reason to smile down the road. 

May the Great Architect of The Universe keep you and your loved ones safe, healthy, and happy this holiday season. 

Sincerely and Fraternally,
