Each year we give thanks and celebrate our thankfulness with a day of Thanksgiving followed by a season of cheer. As Freemaons, especially Scottish Rite Masons, we learn to be thankful at all times. The 32° teaches that man has the Royal Secret,  the eternal gift of the Supreme Architect - love. It is a gift that cannot be imparted to mortal men by others, but was incarnate when man became a living soul. This love is a divine attribute, a precious birthright, a witness that all men are, indeed, the sons of a Supreme Being.

Through that love, we are given the gift of service and of servant leadership. During this month of thankfulness, we will hold a Valley Leadership Conference following our Super Breakfast on November 12, at which your Valley leaders will discuss the strategy that will guide and grow our Valley in the coming years. We will tune our plan for the Valley to become a servant leader to the Craft Lodges of Orange County and a force for unity in Fremasonry, while our Valley establishes a new relevance in the Masonic community as a gathering place for the many lodges we serve.

We look forward to each of you joining us at the Super Breakfast and, if you like, at the gathering that follows. Think of this as an opportunity to show your appreciation for the opportunity to be of service. As always, remember that your spouse, partner or significant other is invited and encouraged to attend this special gathering, as well as our Stated Meeting and Dinner, where we will celebrate the Cap and Ring Ceremony and present a program of great interest to all.

Sincerely and fraternally,
