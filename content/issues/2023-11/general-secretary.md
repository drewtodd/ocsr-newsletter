Brethren: Fall Greetings to all of our members. September was a busy month in our Valley and October promises more to be even more active. Last month, we had an excellent Stated Meeting with good food and a fine presentation by Brother Scot Trodick 32° on our changing technological future with an emphasis on artificial intelligence. Our October Stated Meeting will be on October 2nd at 6:30 pm at the DeMolay Center. You will receive an email before the meeting with the a link allowing you to RSVP. This feature allows us to have an idea of how much food to order.

We are holding our Fall Reunion on Friday, October 6th and Saturday October 7th at the DeMolay Center. The Reunion will begin at 6 pm on Friday with the exemplification of the 4th and 14th degrees. We will resume around 8 am on Saturday morning and we will perform the 18th, 30th and 32nd degrees. At the present, we have a strong class of 8 candidates. Please come by either day to watch a degree and support your Valley and our newest Brothers. We are excited about the enthusiasm for Masonic education shown by our newer Brothers and are looking forward to having this Fall class of new Brothers bringing new ideas to our Valley.

Our Fall Super Breakfast will be on Sunday, November 12th between 9 am and noon. We will be offering a delectable breakfast of custom omelets, bacon, sausage, fresh waffles and more. Please make a point of attending. Tickets will be in the mail to you in a few days. This is an open event and you can buy tickets and give them to family, friends, neighbors, co-workers or anyone. Kids are welcome. The 2 Super Breakfasts per year are the only events we hold where we raise money for the support of our Valley (office expenses, rents, etc.). Our Brothers are always very generous in buying tickets. We missed these breakfasts greatly during the pandemic years. 

Lastly, all of you should have received your notices for 2024 dues along with your 2024 dues card. Many of you have sent in your payments and we thank you. Payments can be made by mailing in a check or by paying online with a credit card. The online payments may be made at our Supreme website which is scottishrite.org  Also, there is a link on our OCSR website which is ocscottishrite.org  If you didn't receive your dues notice or have any questions regarding your dues status, do not hesitate to reach out to the General Secretary at gensec@ocscottishrite.org or telephone number below. Have an exceptional October.

Sincerely and Fraternally,
