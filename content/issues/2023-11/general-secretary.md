Welcome to our 9 newest Masters of the Royal Secret from our Fall Reunion in early October. Our new 32° Scottish Rite Masons expressed a strong interest in further study of our degrees. We hope that they take advantage of our online Master Craftsman programs and also participate in Valley activities. A true adage is that the benefit that a Mason receives from the Craft is directly related to his level of participation.

For those Brothers who were unable to attend the Fall Reunion, you missed a great one. Our exemplification of the 5 mandatory degrees and our classroom communication of the remaining degrees were both superb. The Valley of Orange County thanks our Brothers who participated in putting on the Reunion. We also thank all of the Brothers who attended the Reunion to support our newest members. 

Our November Stated Meeting will be on Monday, November 6th at 6:30 pm. After a brief meeting, we will have dinner and our Cap & Ring ceremony for our 9 new members. Make a point of attending and you will enjoy this event. Our Valley is growing and our future is bright. Finally, may every Brother and his family have a joyous Thanksgiving.

Sincerely and Fraternally,
