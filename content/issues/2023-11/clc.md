Hello and welcome back to the RiteCare Childhood Language Center of Orange County.    

{{< figure src="img/clc.jpg" class="right medium border shadow" caption="Chapman intern Maddie uses a game of Twister to motivate her client to work on his articulation drills. He shows up with a smile each week and is eager to play with and learn with Miss Maddie." >}}

"Play is the work of childhood" is a quote that is attributed to the psychologist, Jean Piaget.  Mr. Rogers expanded upon this quote by saying, "Play is often talked about as if it were a relief from serious learning. But for children, play IS serious learning. Play is really the work of childhood."  Here at CLC, we believe in the importance of play and see children learning through play on a daily basis.  Play provides our clients with a structure in which to learn new vocabulary, word combinations, and sentence structure.  It is a fun, motivating context in which to address attention and language understanding.  

Articulation (speech sound) drills are always more fun when a playful component is involved.  We are thankful that our interns have the opportunity to plan and practice fun, creative, playful activities with our clients on a weekly basis.  Nothing brings us more joy and gratitude than the children who are excited to "play" at CLC and whose families bring us weekly reports of "new words", "confidence in the classroom" and new attempts to communicate with peers and at home. 

Sincerely,
