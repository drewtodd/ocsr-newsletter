Hello Brothers,

I have missed you all being out sick for six weeks. I am thankful for my wife and lovely children, and for my dearest Brothers of the craft. I very am excited to return to service and looking forward to our next stated meeting to reconnect with all of you. Thank you all for the very kind messages while I was out, as they were great moral support.

## Classroom Lecture Series Returns!
I wanted to remind you that I will be hosting a Classroom Lecture Series on Saturday, Nov 18th at Orange Grove Lodge #293 from 8am-5pm. I will be offering a breakdown of the lodge of perfection (journey with a key), Rose Croix (introduction to the many forms of Rosicrucianism), and the Mystic philosophies of the Council of Kadosh. I will also summarize the Consistory and elements of the overall message of the Scottish Rite degree system not directly made known to you.

I will also be covering the basics of other Masonic bodies, their commonalities and differences with the Scottish Rite, and offering a quick tutorial on how to navigate and maximize your efforts using the master craftsman college website.
