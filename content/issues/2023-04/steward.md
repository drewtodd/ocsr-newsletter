Witness the Spring Equinox Awaken the 10-story serpent that slithers down Chichén Itzá
in Mexico! 

One of the most monumental moments of the year is almost upon us, the Spring Equinox.

## What Is an Equinox and Why Is It So Special?
An equinox is a fleeting moment in which the plane of Earth’s equator passes through the center of the Sun’s disk. 
This spectacular phenomenon only happens twice a year, once in the Spring, and once in Autumn. During the equinox, the length of night and day are approximately equal all over the world. The word ‘equinox’ is derived from the Latin aequinoctium, aequus (equal) and nox (genitive noctis) (night).

## What Does It Have to Do with Chichen Itza?

If you are yet to visit Chichen Itza, it’s beneficial to give you some context before delving straight in. Amongst all of the archeological treasures here in Mexico, Chichén Itzá is easily the most famous and well-preserved site.
However, it’s not just a bunch of ruins crawling with tourists, this lost jungle city houses fascinating secrets that span centuries and entire civilizations.

It was a large pre-Columbian city, inhabited by many people.  Despite popular belief, the city wasn’t just built by the Maya People,  another indigenous Mexican group called The Toltecs also had a major influence on the cities development. The Toltecs arrived at Chichén Itza around the 10th century and were integral in developing the Central Zone of the site. Which means when you visit this incredible Wonder Of The World, you’ll have the pleasure of witnessing many architectural styles.

## Kulkulkan
As you roam the grounds of Chichen Itza the mystery and magic of this place will permeate every fiber of your being. You’ll notice many carvings and stone figures in the shape of a snake. This isn’t just any snake, this is Kulkulkhan.

***Kulkulkhan*** (“Plumed Serpent“, “Feathered Serpent“) is the name of a Maya snake deity.

## The Mayans Were Astronomical Geniuses.
Staggeringly, the ancient Mayans who built and inhabited Chichen Itza had an extremely developed understanding of astronomy and science. If you consider the kinds of technology available and accessible to these people back then, it’s hard to believe they built something so incredibly impressive all by themselves. As you can imagine, all kinds of weird and wonderful theories have been discussed over the years and the debate continues, even today.

Perhaps the most notable structure is El Castillo. El Castillo is an intriguing structure, also known as the Pyramid of Kukulkan, or Quetzalcoatl, the 80-foot stone pyramid is a physical depiction of the Mayan calendar.

This particular structure is the largest in the ancient city. It consists of a series of square terraces with stairways up each four sides to the temple on top. Each side has 91 steps, which, when added together and including the platform at the top, produces a total of 365 steps (which is equal to the number of days in a year). The full extent of its brilliance reveals itself during the Spring and Autumn equinox.

## When the Snake Awakens
During the equinox in the late after the sun strikes off the northwest corner of the pyramid and cast a series of triangular shadows against the northwest balustrade, creating the illusion of a feathered serpent “crawling” down the pyramid. It’s an unbelievable and fleeting moment. It makes you wonder whether it is a result of purposeful design. As the sun sets, the snake seemingly slithers down the steps to join a stone serpent head that sits at the base of the great staircase. Coincidence? I think not.

As an example of what the Mesoamerican architects were able to realize  which you shall  visit today, is a famous post classic Mayan town of Yucatán. The Yucatán peninsula is docked with peculiar natural features called Cenotes. A cenote is a sinkwhole which results from the collapse of the bedrock surface and it’s usually filled by ground water. Cenotes were  considered sacred to the Mayas which used them as gateways of spiritual communication with the other world. As a consequence, cast sacrificial offerings, including humans, into them. Its is probably on account of the two imposing Cenotes that Chichen Itza was founded. Around the 10th Century A.D. it became one of the most important cities of the Mayan world. 

So, when can you witness this spectacular Chichen Itza Snake Shadow phenomenon and the Cenotes of Yucatan for yourself?
