## The Dagger of the Sixteenth Degree

The Sixteenth Degree, Prince of Jerusalem, recounts the return of the exiled Jews from their captivity in Babylonia.  There is a lot in this degree, but one symbol that always stood out to me was the dagger on the collar of this degree.  The actual degree provides no explanation, and even Rex Hutchins in A Bridge to Light merely points us to a Bible verse, Judges 3:15-28 as if the reader would already be familiar with the story of King Eglon of Moab and Ehud the Israelite judge.  I could not recall this story, so I had to look it up and refresh my memory.  I thought I would provide a recap of the story here and try to provide some insight into the story’s connection with Freemasonry.

The story begins in that middle part of the Israelites’ history where, according to tradition, they had been expelled from Egypt but not yet set up their own kingdoms in Israel and Judah.  Up to this point, the Israelites had not been doing a great job of keeping Yahweh happy.  So Yahweh gave power to Eglon, the King of Moab, who along with the Ammonites and the Amalekites oppressed the Israelites for 18 years.  The Israelites cried out for a deliverer, and Yahweh gave the people a man named Ehud.  Ehud was a trickster judge, and he had a plan to get rid of King Eglon.  Ehud went to the palace of King Eglon saying he had a tribute, or offering.  Ehud was patted down by the palace guards, however he was able to conceal a dagger strapped to his right thigh that escaped detection.

The story gets interesting when Ehud says to Eglon, “Your Majesty, I have a secret message for you.”  This is the first time we can see a possible connection with Freemasonry.  King Eglon sends his guards away upon hearing this.  The suspense around Ehud’s message gets even more heightened when Ehud now says, “I have a message from God for you.”  Then right as the king started to rise from his seat, Ehud grabbed the dagger he had hidden on his right thigh and plunged it into the king’s stomach using his left hand.  This last part is an important detail to the story that modern readers would probably not pick up on.  It would have been known in ancient times that the left hand was used for handling genitals.  When we understand this, the story takes on a symbolic meaning that would be humiliating to the king.  Judges 3:22 says, “Even the handle sank in after the blade, and his bowels discharged.  Ehud did not pull the sword out, and the fat closed in over it.”  

The story is, on the literal level, about a murder with a dagger, but the dagger, the thigh, the left hand, and the bowels are symbolically telling us that this is the story about sexually humiliating this king.  The Iron Age audience would have picked up on all these tongue and cheek references.  Later in the Book of Judges, in the story of the Levite and his concubine, the angry Benjamite mob demanded to “bring out the man who came to your house so we can have sex with him.”  The message being that homosexual rape was an attack on male honor in the ancient world.  The Israelites wanted to see their leader Ehud succeed and what better way to beat your enemies than to absolutely humiliate them.

The story is not over yet.  This gruesome and violent story is now about to turn comedic.  The guards are starting to notice that Eglon has been gone for a while now, and they at first think that he is taking a long time to go to the bathroom.  When the guards finally decide to bust down the door and check on Eglon, they find their king dead on the floor.  Meanwhile, Ehud escaped and took possession of the fords of the Jordan that lead to Moab.  The Israelites then killed 10,000 Moabites (Judges 3:29).

It’s a perplexing story.  Who is the good guy here?  Are there really any winners?  The Israelites defeated their enemy the Moabites, but it’s unclear exactly what the Moabites were doing in the first place to oppress the Israelites.  In fact, the Moabites and Israelites are descended from the same people.  If you recall back in Genesis 19:30-38, Moab the person was conceived through incest between Lot and his eldest daughter.  Furthermore, the story begins by saying that the Israelites had sinned against Yahweh, and therefore Yahweh allowed Eglon to oppress the Israelites as punishment, so the Moabites weren’t oppressing anybody of their own free will.  In fact, the Moabites were in the land first.  As it says back in Joshua 24:18, “And the Lord drove out before us all the nations, including the Amorites, who lived in the land.”  

Whatever the meaning of the story, the Moabites remain an important people.  Later in the Book of Ruth, we will learn, also in suspenseful fashion, that in another meeting of the Moabites and Israelites, a Moabite woman named Ruth and an Israelite man named (wait for it) yes, Boaz, would conceive a child named Obed, who would conceive a child name Jesse, who would conceive a child name David.  Yes, that David.  So the Moabites and the Israelites are inextricably linked.  They came from the same ancestors, fought over the same land, and in the end married into one another to produce a royal line of kings.  

The Masonic lesson is that even small references in degrees can often be some of the most important details.  It may be something as small as a dagger on a collar in the sixteenth degree or a strange word to remember in the first degree, but it is often these small details that point you in the direction you should be looking.  The degrees themselves are never going to fully reveal anything.  They only provide hints, often in the most obscure places.  The real work of the Mason is to seek out these hints and study them carefully, like here with the story of Ehud and Eglon, to make these stories give up their real secrets.  Ehud had a secret for Eglon after all–direct from God of all people.  Whatever this secret, it was never divulged in the story.  Will you be able to figure it out?

Until next month, brothers...
