Hello from all of us at RiteCare Childhood Language Center of Orange County!  St. Patrick’s Day and the arrival of Spring has made March a very exciting month for  our clients.  The clinic is adorned with green shamrocks, rainbows and leprechauns, all adding to our children’s  enjoyment the season and provinding yet  another great opportunity to add new language to their lessons.

This month we have evaluated children with a variety of speech and language needs  and have  enrolled them in our clinic.  We are grateful for the opportunity to be able  to provide  support for  their needs .  The continued growth allows us to maximize the benefits of our clinic for our students. 

The children have been very busy learning new words, concepts, and communication for  their wants and needs. In this picture, Olivia has learned new words while coloring during her therapy session, (her favorite activity), and continues to acquire more skills each time we see her!

The student clinicians as well have  been thriving this semester, learning new skills each week, and building relationships with our families. Our student clinicians are currently in their third to last week of the semester, wrapping up therapy and preparing progress reports to provide to updates for our families. Each week, the supervisors have had the privilege of watching our student clinicians become increasingly independent and find their “groove” as soon-to-be Speech-Language Pathologists.
As we wrap up this semester, we  look forward to continuing our services during  the summer semester, a  critical time of year where children’s  learned skills can regress during a large break in therapy. We are always grateful for the opportunity to serve our clients and provide training to our student clinicians!

Sincerely,
