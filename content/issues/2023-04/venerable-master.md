## Seneca: Stoicism's Great Catalyst

Greetings, bothers. I hope this article finds you all doing well.

In my previous article, I talked about the life and philosophy of Zeno of Citium, the founder of the Stoic school of thought. Today, I want to shift the focus to another prominent figure in Stoicism: Lucius Annaeus Seneca .

Born in Spain in 4 BCE, Seneca (or Secena the Younger, as he was also referred) was a philosopher, statesman, and playwright who lived during the Roman Empire. He was a remarkable historical figure who made significant contributions to philosophy, literature, and politics.

As a young man, Seneca studied rhetoric and philosophy in Rome and Athens, where he became interested in Stoicism. He later became a tutor and advisor to the emperor Nero, the notorious tyrant. Seneca’s relationship with Nero was complex - on one hand, he was able to influence Nero’s decisions and bring about positive changes for the people of Rome, but on the other hand, he was also complicit in Nero’s oppressive regime.

Despite his complicated relationship with Nero, Seneca’s philosophy stands the test of time. His writings, including his [Letters from a Stoic](https://www.amazon.com/Letters-Penguin-Classics-Lucius-Annaeus/dp/0140442103/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=letters+from+a+stoic&sr=8-1), continue to inspire people to this day. In his philosophy, Seneca emphasized the importance of reason, self-control, and self-reflection in achieving inner peace and happiness — topics that I’ll cover in depth in future newsletter articles.

In addition to his philosophical contributions, Seneca was also a prolific playwright, writing tragedies that were performed in the Roman theater. His works were admired for their powerful language and emotional depth.

> “It is not that we have a short time to live, but that we waste a lot of it. Life is long enough, and a sufficiently generous amount has been given to us for the highest achievements if it were all well invested. But when it is wasted in heedless luxury and spent on no good activity, we are forced at last by death’s final constraint to realize that it has passed away before we knew it was passing. So it is: we are not given a short life but we make it short, and we are not ill-supplied but wasteful of it… Life is long if you know how to use it.” - Seneca, [On the Shortness of Life](https://www.amazon.com/Shortness-Life-Penguin-Great-Ideas/dp/0143036327/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=on+the+shortness+of+life+seneca&sr=8-1).  

It’s worth noting that Seneca was fabulously wealthy, in stark contrast to the story of Zeno, who lost everything before he founded the Stoic school. Seneca’s wealth was acquired through his work as a successful lawyer and later as a high-ranking official in the Roman government.

Despite his wealth and status, Seneca remained committed to the principles of Stoicism. He believed that material possessions and external circumstances were not the key to happiness, and instead emphasized the importance of inner peace and self-reflection.
In fact, Seneca famously wrote about the dangers of wealth and the ways in which it can corrupt individuals. He believed that life was meant to be lived virtuously, and that the pursuit of wealth for its own sake could ultimately lead to unhappiness and dissatisfaction. Unlike many more ascetic-minded scholars from other philosophical schools, however, Seneca did eschew the trappings of wealth.

Seneca’s personal life and wealth are certainly an interesting contrast to the story of Zeno, but it’s important to remember that both figures were ultimately united by their commitment to the Stoic philosophy and their belief in the power of reason and self-control.

> “Money has never yet made anyone rich.” - Seneca, [Letters from a Stoic](https://www.amazon.com/Letters-Penguin-Classics-Lucius-Annaeus/dp/0140442103/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=letters+from+a+stoic&sr=8-1).  

One of Seneca’s most famous ideas is the concept of “memento mori,” which translates to “remember that you must die.” This may sound morbid (and extremely Masonic), but the idea behind it is to remind us that life is short and that we should make the most of every moment. In a world where we’re often consumed by our day-to-day tasks and stresses, it’s easy to forget the bigger picture. Seneca’s reminder to live in the present and appreciate each moment is still just as important today.

Seneca’s own death was just as notable as his life. In 65 CE, Seneca was implicated in a plot to assassinate the emperor Nero, who had become increasingly paranoid and tyrannical. Despite Seneca’s protests of innocence, Nero ordered him to commit suicide as punishment for his alleged involvement in the plot.

His death was also a poignant example of his commitment to Stoic philosophy. He faced it with courage and dignity, refusing to allow fear or despair to overcome him. Before he died, Seneca wrote to a friend, saying, “I am not writing this under compulsion, since it is always my habit to write to you, but on the brink of death I am writing with my own blood.” He then opened his veins and peacefully passed away.

Seneca’s death is a testament to the Stoic philosophy he espoused throughout his life. He believed that death was a natural part of life, and that the only thing we could control was our response to it. His calm acceptance of his own death stands as a powerful example of the strength and resilience that Stoicism can offer in even the most difficult of circumstances.

His ideas continue to resonate with people today, and his legacy serves as a testament to the enduring power of Stoicism.

Stay tuned, brothers. Next month we’ll move on to a Stoic philosopher who was profoundly influenced by Seneca: Epectitus.

Until then, be well.
