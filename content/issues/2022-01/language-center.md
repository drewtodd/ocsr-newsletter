# Language Center News

Welcome back to the RiteCare Childhood Language Center or Orange County! December is always a fun time to be in the clinic! The air is crispy the children are excited for Christmas, and the student clinicians are excited for their break (the supervisors are too). There is an energy that takes over this time of year that just cannot be match. 

This semester at the clinic has been a huge success. We have been able to administer many new assessments and provide therapy for a lot of children. Despite some scheduling challenges and multiple cancellations, we had a great amount of growth in everyone who attended, and the student clinicians learned a great deal about being flexible in therapy sessions and going with the flow. We could not be prouder of them. As we wrap up the month, semester, and year we see so much of the hard work we have put in paying off. We celebrated the graduation of some children from the clinic, and we congratulated student clinicians who are now one step closer to completely their program.

To celebrate the holidays, the student clinicians designed wonderfully creative therapy sessions including cookie decorating, Christmas tree ball tosses and so much more. The children were able to continue to grow in their speech and language skills and still get wrapped up in the holidays (pun intended). On the final days of sessions, each child received a personalized gift from the Scottish Rite. Watching children unwrap gifts is always a special treat. The jumping, dancing and smiles are unparallel to anything else. They were all truly grateful, and we received many messages from parents afterwards thanking us for such special treats. One parent even sent in a photo of her child napping with the new gift, kicking the old, favored toy to the curb. 

We are so grateful for all the support that allows us to not only have the clinic up and running but also allows us to give generously into the lives of each child who walks through our doors. As we wrap up this year and look excitedly into next year, we are eager to see the continued growth of each child and student clinicians. 

Happy new year!
