# Wise Master Elect

Greetings Brethren,

I am looking forward to a new Scottish Rite year as your Wise Master elect in the Chapter Rose Croix and am even more excited to have our own Venerable elect, David Frias to my immediate right up there in the East, such as we were a few years ago with him as Commander (Council of Kadosh) and myself as Master of Kadosh (Consistory). How comforting indeed to partner with him again (as well as the other head of bodies)!!!

Many of you already know what I am continuously relearning; the four Chapter Degrees (while relatively few) are some of the most beautiful in all of Freemasonry (15° - 18°). Candidates do well in the presence of Faith, Hope and Charity together defined as the Law of Love (or simply 'Compassion') being the safe guides of action through life for the purpose of arriving at Truth (or perhaps suggested as the final solution). Finally, the degrees commence with a capstone, or test which, for obvious reasons the Scottish Rite became known as the 'College of Masonry'.

My intentions to walk in and out of these degrees this year as foundations of my monthly articles is threefold: observe, educate, and inspire. I hope that one leads the other or... to the other, on and on, and that my musings are not only entertaining but leave one enjoying some depth in our newsletter. I apologize in advance if I drift tangentially too far away from centerline, but I also invite feedback or corrections where noticeable. Iron sharpening iron, as they say in Proverbs.

What am I thinking about lately other than Masonry? I get asked a lot about Crypto. Specially, what is it, where do I start, are we doomed? I'm not sure if its because I appear young and presumably smart in this niche, work in technology or simply because it's a hot topic on everybody's minds lately. Both my Mom and former Stepmom inquired at Christmas dinner last month which tells me it's approaching general vernacular. My answer in short, it's a huge space right now with potentially positive disruptions to be found almost everywhere (even world peace in one extreme example). Those interested, I would start by following the most intelligent and experienced people in this arena and then quite simply, tweak and/or mimic what they are doing. I recommend reading The Price of Tomorrow: Why Deflation is the Key to an Abundant Future by Jeff Booth. Subscribe to InvestAnswers or listen to Michael Saylor for those of you who are YouTube savvy. Happy travels!

In our calls to the Almoner, remember Brethren: He who giveth to charity, lendeth to the Lord. See you all in January.

Sincerely & Fraternally,
