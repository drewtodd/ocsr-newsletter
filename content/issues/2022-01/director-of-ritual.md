## Joshua and Muhammad–A Masonic Duad

In the Master Mason chapter of Morals and Dogma, Albert Pike warns about the dangers of hypocrisy and ambition. Pike says that the highest object of human ambition is to subjugate the will of others because it is the exercise of the highest power. He points out that this subjugation of the will is at the bottom of both proselytizing and propagandism, and gives the example of the Catholic Church for the former and the French Republic for the latter. He then makes the following curious statement but provides no explanation: “That was the apostolate alike of Joshua and Mahomet.” What did Pike mean by this statement, and is this an accurate comparison?

The Joshua mentioned here is the famed assistant to Moses and the main character of the book that bears his name in the Hebrew Bible, and the Mahomet (modern spelling, Muhammad) mentioned here is the prophet and founder of the faith of Islam. An apostolate usually refers to a religious leader, but can also refer to evangelistic activity, which is the meaning Pike intends in his quote. Pike most likely chose these two men in his discussion of ambition due to their actions as military leaders.

The first similarity between the two men is that the land which each conquered was inhabited by polytheistic peoples. Joshua 3:10 says, “he |Yahweh| will certainly drive out among you the Canaanites, Hittites, Perizzites, Girgashites, Amorites, and Jebusites.” These were various Canaanite peoples who worshiped local tribal gods of the area, such as El, Asherah, Moloch, and Ba’al. Likewise, the people inhabiting pre-Islamic Arabia were also polytheistic; they worshiped a pantheon of 360 different gods, including Hubal, the main god of Mecca, and the three principal goddesses of Mecca: Al-Lat, Manat, and Al-Uzza.

The main criticism Pike has of these two men is not so much their religious dogmas as the manner in which they sought to spread them. The Book of Joshua describes how the inhabitants of Cannan were conquered. “When Israel had finished killing all the men of Ai in the fields and in the wilderness where they had chased them, and when every one of them had been put to the sword, all the Israelites returned to Ai and killed those who were in it (Joshua 8:24).” Muhammad also had some bloody conflicts with local tribes, most notably at the Battle of the Trench where the men were executed, and the women and children were captured (Esposito, 2003, p. 15).

Another similarity is the manner in which each man entered the city he was about to conquer. Joshua and his army marched around the city of Jericho seven times before they moved in and took the city (Joshua 6:15). Likewise, Muhammad is said to have circled the Kaaba, the most holy site of Islam, seven times after his conquest of Mecca (Peters, 1994, pp. 125-126).
An important distinction between the two accounts is the time period in which each was written. The Quran was completed in 632 CE and is much closer to the modern period than the Book of Joshua, which was most likely written during the reign of King Josiah of Israel in the 7th century BCE, and was recounting events which would have purportedly taken place during the late 13th century BCE. In other words, the events around the time of Muhammad are more apt to be subject to critical historical methods than the Book of Joshua. In fact, almost all scholars agree that the account in Joshua holds little value from a historical perspective (Killebrew, 2005, p. 52).

Why would the narrative of the Book of Joshua be written in such a way that it would be left open to the criticism that people like Pike would levy on it? The answer may provide an example of Pike’s second charge against subjugation–the propaganda. The narrative is most likely a folk-historical account that explains how the Israelites could claim the right to lands that were already occupied by other peoples at that time. There are a number of competing theories on the actual historical events. The names of some of the Twelve Tribes of Israel may provide a clue. Asher was one of the Twelve Tribes and Ashur was the solar deity of the Assyrians, and Asherah was a mother goddess of fertility of the Akkadians. Gad was the name of both a tribe and a Canaanite god (Levine, 2001, p. 59).

Both men are also visited by angel characters prior to going into battle. Joshua 5:13-15 recounts a mysterious encounter with “a man standing in front of him with a drawn sword in his hand.” Joshua asks the man, “Are you for us or for our enemies?” The man gives the cryptic answer, “Neither.” It’s never revealed who this man was, but the man ultimately said that he was on Joshua’s side, and Joshua could now proceed with the divine decree into battle.

Muhammad had a similar encounter with the angel Gabriel who helped him defeat the army of the Quraysh, the most powerful tribe of Mecca, of which Muhammad was born a member.

Lastly, both men also have stone lore associated with their battles. Joshua 4 tells the story of how God commanded Joshua to take twelve stones from the Jordan River and set them down in their camp where they were to act as a memorial to the people of Israel. “And they are there to this day.” According to tradition, Muhammad set the Black Stone of the Kaaba in its place. The Black Stone was first around at the time of Adam and Eve but was lost in the flood. Ibrahim (Abraham) subsequently found the stone and instructed his son Ismael (Ishmael) to construct a site to house the stone, which became the Kaaba.

The examples above hopefully shed some light on Pike’s charges of subjugation and ambition. Several statements in the previous “Fellowcraft” chapter in Morals & Dogma provide some further depth to his criticisms. In this chapter, Solon, the Athenian lawgiver, is asked if his countrymen have the best laws. His response is that they have “the best they are capable of receiving.” Pike expounds on this idea in this section and admonishes us that we should not be too quick to judge the sincerely held beliefs of others just because those beliefs may be different from our own. Pike, quoting George Henry Lewes says, “Catholicism was a vital truth in its earliest ages, but it became obsolete, and Protestantism arose, flourished, and deteriorated.” Pike says the doctrines of Zoroaster were the best for the ancient Persians, Confucianism for the Chinese, and “those of Muhammad for the idolatrous Arabs of his age.”

Later on in the same chapter, however, Pike introduces the concept of faith and how one group of people with a stronger faith than another can supplant the people with the weaker faith. “When Christianity had grown weak, profitless, and powerless, the Arab Restorer and Iconoclast came, like a cleansing hurricane…The Faith of the Arab had become stronger than that of the Christian, and he conquered (M&D, pp.124-125).” This seems to contradict what Pike said earlier in the chapter. At first, Pike said we need to respect others because different beliefs are adapted to different times and places. But now Pike is saying that it’s possible that someone’s beliefs could become outdated, and a new faith could come along and actually become a “Redeemer of nations (M&D, p. 124).”

On one hand, the conquests of Joshua and Muhammad did exhibit signs of ambition and subjugation, however Pike also argues that they were a necessary part of a process to bring about new stages of human spiritual evolution. This echoes Hegel’s theory of history in his 1807 work Phenomenology of Spirit where history is seen as a series of events that work themselves out in contradiction to one another ultimately leading to progress. This sounds decidedly Masonic as well. Pike ends the chapter with a discussion on the symbolism of numbers and calls the number two “the symbol of Antagonism: of Good and Evil, Light and Darkness. It is Cain and Abel, Eve and Lilith, Jachin and Boaz, Ormuzd and Ahriman, Osiris and Typhon (M&D, p. 132).” The 27th Degree teaches us the Hermetical adage to “analyze and synthesize.” Maybe that’s the Masonic lesson that brings Pike’s contradistinguished ideas of this chapter into a unified whole. Instead of one side being right or wrong, the task is to find a way to hold these differing ideas in the mind and produce a unified third path, which results in progress. After all, human progress is our cause.
