Greetings from the West!

We are excited to invite you to our first Classroom Lecture Series of the year on Saturday, May 13th! This informative session will be held at the Anaheim Demolay Center from 8am-5pm. 

During this event, we will be doing a deep-dive into the materials presented in the 4th-32nd degrees during our past weekend's reunion. It's a great opportunity to expand your knowledge and understanding of the Scottish Rite.

> Please make plans to join us on **Saturday, May 13th** for our first **Classroom Lecture Series** of the year! This informative session runs from 8am-5pm at the Anaheim Demolay Center.

Our Classroom Lecture Series is an ongoing program designed to enhance your Masonic education. It's a collaborative learning experience where we explore Masonic teachings, symbolism, history, and philosophy. The lectures are presented by experienced Masons who are experts in their respective fields, ensuring that you receive accurate and valuable information.

We encourage all brethren, regardless of their degree, to attend this event. It's an excellent opportunity to gain insight into the Scottish Rite and its teachings. We welcome any questions you may have, and our presenters will be available to answer them during the Q&A session at the end of each lecture.

We are committed to providing you with the best educational opportunities available, and our Classroom Lecture Series is just one of the many ways we do that. We hope you'll join us on May 13th for this exciting event.
