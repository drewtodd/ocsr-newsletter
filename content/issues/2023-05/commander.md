## Top Five Scottish Rite Architectural Wonders

If you only visited our valley in Anaheim, you would think the Scottish Rite was a quaint fraternal organization, but if you visit some of these sites around the country, you’ll realize the Scottish Rite is a huge organization with a storied history.  This list is my personal opinion of the top five Scottish Rite sites around the country.  I have visited some of these in person, but most of my opinion is based on what I have garnered from my online research.  Without further ado, let’s start with number five.

### Scottish Rite Consistory - Des Moines, Iowa

I actually had the good fortune to visit this building on a road trip last year and it blew me away.  Most people would not expect to find such an impressive building in Des Moines, but I think it really deserves a spot in the top five in the country.  When I stopped by on my road trip, the front door of the temple was open.  I just walked right in and asked if I could look around.  A brother happened to be there, and he was gracious enough to show me around.  The most striking thing I found about this place was that it was in such good condition; you could tell it had been recently renovated.  The valley membership looks strong, and I hope they are around for years to come.


### Scottish Rite Valley of St. Louis

This building is even larger than the one in Des Moines and is quite imposing.  The Valley of St. Louis is famous for putting on the virtual reunions during the pandemic.  They have a huge stage, and the slender columns outside give the building an imposing feeling.


### Kansas City Scottish Rite

I attempted to go inside this temple as well on my road trip, but it was closed on the day I visited.  This temple is dubbed the “mini House of Temple” because it has an almost identical architectural design, complete with two sphinxes out front.


### House of the Temple - Washington, D.C.

I had the honor of visiting the House of Temple last year in Washington D.C.  This is a most amazing building, and it has a diversity of places to explore inside.  It’s not just a main temple room, although that alone is impressive.  It also has a beautiful library, complete with old, dusty tomes and those sliding ladders to reach the books on the top shelf.  The executive chamber looks like a throne room, and the libraries and museums on the bottom floor are well worth a visit.  There is such great attention to detail in the building with little things added to the detail which could easily be overlooked, like the statues of Hermes on the light fixtures in the main lobby.  

### Guthrie Scottish Rite - Guthrie, OK

And coming in at number one is Guthrie, Oklahoma.  I had never even heard of Guthrie before hearing of this temple and it’s still unbelievable that such an imposing building is in such a remote location.  The reason this building ended up being in Guthrie is that this building almost was the state capitol building of Oklahoma.  We know now that the capital ended up being moved to Oklahoma City, and the Scottish Rite took the building in Guthrie.  This temple grabs the top spot because it has distinct rooms for different themes in our degrees.  The Assyrian Room really grabbed my attention as the Assyrian conquest of the Israelites under Tiglath-Pileser III is a critical detail in uncovering the secrets of the Bible.  In the same vein, Guthrie also has an Egyptian room complete with a ceiling painted with stars showing the importance of not following the admonition in Deuteronomy 4:19.  I wasn’t able to visit Guthrie on my road trip, but it is definitely on the top of my list.
