## Family

In Masonry, family is highly esteemed,  
A source of strength, support, and love, it seems,  
For in our brothers and sisters, we find  
A bond that's steadfast, unbroken, and kind.

Family goes beyond just blood and relation,  
It's a connection that endures, without hesitation,  
It's the love we share, the memories we make,  
The times we celebrate, and the moments we take.  

As Masons, we value the sanctity of family,  
The ties that bind us, and keep us happy,  
For in our families, we find a sense of belonging,  
A place to call home, a space for growing.

We teach our children the ways of Masonry,  
To live a life that's noble, virtuous, and free,  
To value honesty, integrity, and truth,  
To serve others, and to be of good use. 

But we also teach them the importance of family,  
To cherish the ties that bind us, so grandly,  
To be there for each other, through thick and thin,  
And to always remember, the love within.

For in our families, we find a mirror,  
A reflection of the values we hold dear,  
The love we share is the love we give,  
The life we lead is the life we live.  

Through Masonry, we learn to be a better person,  
To make a positive impact, without worsen,  
To be there for our brothers, in good times and bad,  
To lift each other up, when we're feeling sad.  

And in our families, we find a source of inspiration,  
A reason to live, with love and appreciation,  
For the moments we share, and the memories we create,  
Are the ones that make life worthwhile, and great.  
 
So, let us hold our families close,  
And cherish the Masonic family, with a dose  
Of gratitude and appreciation, for all they do,  
For they are the ones who make life worthwhile, and see us through.
