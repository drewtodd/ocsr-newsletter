Welcome back to the RiteCare Childhood Language Center of Orange County.  The weather is changing and our children are blooming into fantastic communicators.  Spring is in the air! 

Speech difficulties can have a profound impact on a child's life, affecting their ability to communicate, form friendships, and succeed academically. Sadly, many families cannot afford private speech therapy, leaving children with limited access to the services they need to overcome these difficulties. That's where our charity comes in!

Our charity provides free speech language therapy to children with speech difficulties, helping them overcome their challenges and improve their communication skills. All donations go towards providing high quality Speech-Language therapy to the children and families who attend our Language Center. We have very limited administrative costs or other overhead expenses, ensuring that 100% of donations go towards providing therapy services to children in need.

The impact of our charity's work cannot be overstated. Through our efforts, we have helped countless children overcome speech difficulties, enabling them to communicate more effectively with their families, form friendships, and succeed academically. Without our charity's services, many of these children would not have had access to the therapy they need to improve their communication skills and lead fulfilling lives.

We urge you to consider donating to our charity and helping us continue our important work. Your donations will make a real impact in the lives of children with speech difficulties, helping them overcome their challenges and achieve their full potential. Together, we can make a difference in the lives of these children and give them the tools they need to succeed.

Thank you for all of the support we receive!

Sincerely
