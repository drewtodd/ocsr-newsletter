David is a Certified Public Accountant in California and an avid musician, serving as Treasurer on the temple board for his lodge and as Lodge Organist on classical guitar. Balancing Masonic commitments with his personal life has not been an issue. All of his degrees, both Blue Lodge and Scottish Rite, have been tremendously significant, and he wants to attend events and keep learning.

## The Life, Philosophy, and Impact of Epictetus: A Stoic's Journey

In this third installment of our year-long series on Stoicism, we delve into the life and teachings of Epictetus, one of the most influential Stoic philosophers. In previous articles, we've explored the foundations of Stoicism, its relation to Masonic philosophy, and examined the lives and ideas of other prominent Stoic figures. Now, let's turn our attention to the life, philosophy, and impact of Epictetus, and examine how his teachings align with the principles we uphold as Scottish Rite Masons.

{{< figure src="img/epectitus2.png" class="clear border shadow" alt="An AI-generated image of a sculpture of the philosopher Epectitus" >}}

### Epictetus: A Life of Adversity

Epictetus (circa 50-135 AD) was born in Hierapolis, Phrygia (present-day Turkey) and lived through a tumultuous time in Roman history. As a young boy, he was enslaved and brought to Rome, where he served as a slave to Epaphroditos, a wealthy freedman and secretary to the Roman Emperor Nero. Despite his circumstances, Epictetus pursued the study of philosophy, particularly Stoicism, under the tutelage of the renowned Stoic philosopher Musonius Rufus.

> "Circumstances don't make the man; they only reveal him to himself." -- Epectitus

His life took a turn for the better after he was granted his freedom following the death of Nero. Epictetus began teaching philosophy in Rome, but when Emperor Domitian banished all philosophers from the city in 89 AD, he relocated to Nicopolis in Greece. There, he founded a school and taught philosophy for the rest of his life.

### Philosophy and Teachings

Epictetus's teachings were primarily passed down through the works of his student, Arrian, who compiled them in the "Discourses" and the "Enchiridion." Epictetus's philosophy revolved around the concept of focusing on what is within our control and accepting what is not. He emphasized the importance of self-discipline, inner strength, and virtue, which are also core values within Masonic teachings.

> "It is not events that disturb people, it is their judgments concerning them." -- Epectitus

Epictetus believed that our happiness and well-being depend on how we respond to external events, rather than the events themselves. He taught that by cultivating inner strength and self-control, we can achieve a state of tranquility and contentment. One of his most famous quotes encapsulates this idea: "Men are disturbed not by things, but by the views which they take of them."

{{< figure src="img/epectitus3.png" class="clear border shadow" alt="An AI-generated image of the philosopher Epectitus teaching students" >}}

### The Impact of Epictetus

Epictetus's teachings have had a profound and lasting impact on Western thought. His ideas have influenced numerous philosophers, from Roman emperor Marcus Aurelius to modern-day thinkers. They have also found their way into various self-help books and therapeutic practices, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy.

### Epictetus and Masonic Philosophy

The principles of Epictetus's Stoic philosophy closely align with the values and teachings of the Scottish Rite Masons. Both emphasize the importance of personal growth, self-discipline, and striving for moral and ethical excellence. The teachings of Epictetus can inspire us to be more resilient in the face of adversity, to maintain a calm demeanor in the midst of chaos, and to lead a life grounded in truth and virtue.

> "If you want to improve, be content to be thought foolish and stupid." -- Epectitus

As we continue our exploration of Stoic philosophy, we find that the life and teachings of Epictetus offer valuable insights and lessons that can enrich our Masonic journey. By embracing the wisdom of this great philosopher, we can develop a deeper understanding of our own Masonic principles and strive to embody the virtues that define our fraternal organization.

In our next installment, we will explore the life and philosophy of the most famous Stoic philosopher, the great Roman emperor **Marcus Aurelius**.

Until then, be well.
