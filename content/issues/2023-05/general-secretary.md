 Brethren: This month and next month will be very active for our Valley. On April 21st & 22nd we will be holding our Reunion for new members at the DeMolay Center in Anaheim. Due to the pandemic this is the first time in several years that we are holding a Reunion at our home. We presently have 6 enthusiastic candidates and may have more by the time of the event. Please come by to watch a degree and support your Valley. The theme of this April newsletter is renewal and no Scottish Rite event is more concerned with renewal than our biannual Reunion. Reunion gives each member the opportunity to review our ritual and degrees to remind, reinforce and renew his commitment to the Ancient & Accepted Scottish Rite of Freemasonry.

The tickets for our Annual Super Breakfast on May 7th will be mailed out soon. This is the only event that we hold that benefits our Valley. All of the proceeds go to Valley of Orange County to help in all of our expenses. This is a fun event and a great meal. Please plan on attending. If you have any questions or concerns about your current dues situation, please don't hesitate to contact the Secretary. Lastly, our Stated Meeting is on April 3rd at 6:30 pm at the DeMolay Center. Lately, our meetings have well attended and the fellowship at the dinner following the meeting has been outstanding. Have a great April.     

Fraternally,
