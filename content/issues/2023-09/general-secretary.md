Brethren: With the start of Fall later this month, 2023 is passing quickly. This month, our dues notices for 2024 membership will be arriving. Dues can now be paid online with a credit card. A link on our OC Scottish Rite website (ocscottishrite.org) will take you to the payment portal. And, you are still welcome to send your check in to the Valley Office. If you have any questions about your membership status, please contact the Secretary.

Along with our Personal Representative, I had the great opportunity to attend the Biennial Meeting of the Ancient & Accepted Scottish Rite (S.J.) in Washington D.C. in late August. A major theme discussed was Restoration, Retention & Engagement of members. Restoration involves bringing back members who may have demitted or been suspended. This also includes Brothers who are several years behind in their dues and not yet suspended. We have very favorable programs in place that involve a reduced charge to become current or reactivate your membership. Also, any Brother who demitted in good standing only has to pay the current year's dues to reactivate his membership.

Retention & Engagement are closely related and critical to the success of our Rite. We need to make sure that we have programs that engage our members and create enthusiasm for attending our Valley functions. This will ensure that members value and maintain their memberships. Engagement also includes outreach programs. These involve reaching out to our members who can no longer attend meetings as well as introducing our Fraternity to our local community. If you have ideas to offer on these matters, please speak to our Venerable Master, Personal Representative, General Secretary or any of the Heads of Bodies.

Lastly, we have our Fall Reunion coming up on October 6th (Friday evening) and October 7th (Saturday day). Please come by one of the days to check out a degree and support our candidates. Our September Stated Meeting is on Monday, September 11th at 6:30 pm. Have an exceptional September.

Sincerely and Fraternally,
