What a great time it is to be a Scottish Rite Mason, especially here in Orange County Valley. Over the past few years, Ill. Frankie Rosario has led the Valley through many changes and improvements, and I am excited to build on the firm foundation that has been laid. Building, by its nature, involves change, and you should be aware of recent changes that will have a positive impact on our future.

Bro. Russell Hennings has been appointed Wise Master of the Chapter Rose Croix, and Bro. Alejo Velarde as Commander of Kadosh. In addition to his role as CLC Board President, Bro. Jack Hennings has been appointed Assistant to the Personal Representative. In that role, Bro. Jack will be responsible for monitoring the operational functions of the Valley, alongside our General Secretary Hon. Jamie Hopkins.

> As we look to the future, we are pleased that our Valley is growing - we will have 15 or more new members this year alone.

As we look to the future, we are pleased that our Valley is growing - we will have 15 or more new members this year alone. Now we need to work on our attendance and engagement, so I’ll share some thoughts in that regard. We know that there are a handful of motivators that drive attendance - Duty, Program, Social Interaction and, of course, Food.

Duty is attendance by those who are required to come to meetings. The Heads of Bodies, General Secretary, Treasurer and various other Valley Leaders. This has and will remain constant.

Social Interaction is the friendly gatherings that happen outside our meetings at meal times and other functions. This suffered during the pandemic, and we have been gradually addressing improving in this area. Improvement in addressing the remaining two motivators will drive this one forward.

Program is one of the truly major forces behind attendance and engagement. The Scottish Rite bills itself as the “College of Masonry”, and it is Masonic Education that supports this. Every month, we will present an entertaining and informative program - some will be part of our Distinguished Speaker series, some will be fun activities such as the Masonic Jeopardy that was featured in August, some will somewhere along the continuum between those two.

Food almost speaks for itself. Some of you remember nice dinners our ladies attended throughout the months. This practice declined in the years preceding the pandemic, and we have been gradually improving. I can fairly say that August was a really great meal, and sets the standard for what is to come in our future - delicious meals we enjoy in the company of brethren and ladies accompanied by an enjoyable program that will entertain and inform the attendees.

> At our September meeting, we especially invite our ladies, to have an activity of their own and to discuss what they’d like to do in the future.

Speaking of ladies, we want them to join with us whenever they can. At our September meeting, we especially invite our ladies, to have an activity of their own and to discuss what they’d like to do in the future. We really want as many of the ladies as possible to engage in that discussion, so be sur to bring your spouse or partner to the September 11 meeting.

I look forward to seeing you at the next meeting, and as we grow our attendance and engagement, I look forward to your involvement.

Sincerely and fraternally,
