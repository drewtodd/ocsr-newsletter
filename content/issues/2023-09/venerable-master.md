## A Valley in Jeoparty: In the Best Way Possible
I want to take a moment to thank all the brothers who stuck around for dinner after the August Stated Meeting. Attendance was up, and I can honestly say that it was one of the most engaging evenings in the Orange County Valley in awhile. We had a great meal, and a great time!

### Masonic Jeoparty!
Special thanks to our Senior Warden, Hon. James McCallion for hosting a rousing round of "Masonic Jeoparty!" For those who couldn't make it to this event, it's exactly what it sounds like: A game show-format with Masonic-themed answers and questions. It was a lot of fun, and we got to see some of our brothers flex their Masonic knowledge muscles. Brother McCallion did a superb job of putting together a group of answers that really challenged the contestants, and everyone in the room.
### A Visit from the Shrine
We had the honor of hosting the Potentate of the El Bekal Shrine (and Scottish Rite brother) Illustrious Sir. Merrett Read and his lovely wife, Kim. Sir. In addition to members from El Bekal, we had the privilege of hosting Ill. ******** from the Long Beach Scottish Rite. They brought life to our meeting and stayed for dinner and games afterward. A heartfelt thanks to all of our visitors for attending and gracing us with your words and presence.

## Applying Stoic Wisdom to Our Modern Lives: Part 1 – Reflection
Greetings, brothers. Our journey through the rich history of Stoic philosophy has so far acquainted us with its prominent figures – Zeno, Epictetus, Seneca, and Marcus Aurelius. As we've uncovered their timeless wisdom, the question that naturally arises is, “How can I apply these Stoic principles to my modern-day life?” 

Wonder no more. This article marks the beginning of a pivot in our series where we focus on practical applications., focusing on three essential Stoic practices:

1. **Reflection** 
2. **Negative Visualization**
3. **Voluntary Discomfort**

For this month’s installment, let’s dive into the first practice – Reflection – with the wisdom of Epectitus, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius guiding us.

### Reflection: A Vital Part of the Stoic's Toolbox
Reflection, in the Stoic sense, is the practice of turning inward and analyzing one's thoughts, actions, and experiences. It’s about gaining self-awareness and insight, which, in turn, leads to a more balanced and fulfilled life. Two prominent ways of reflecting are through journaling and meditation.

#### Journaling Like Seneca and Marcus Aurelius
For both Seneca and Marcus Aurelius, journaling was an essential daily practice. They found solace and clarity by penning down their thoughts, experiences, and insights.

##### Seneca’s Wisdom
Seneca, a statesman and Stoic philosopher, often wrote [letters and essays](https://a.co/d/iF2T5Oe) that exemplified his reflective process.

> "We should every night call ourselves to an account; What infirmity have I mastered today? What passions opposed? What temptation resisted? What virtue acquired? Our vices will abort of themselves if they be brought every day to the shrift." - *Seneca*

Seneca advocates for daily reflection as a means to overcome personal flaws and foster virtue. By questioning oneself regularly, one can pinpoint areas that need improvement and take steps to address them.

#### The Meditations of Marcus Aurelius
Emperor Marcus Aurelius, on the other hand, used his journal for personal reflections, which were later compiled into the book ‘[Meditations](https://a.co/d/7wf8GOa)'. His writings reveal a man deeply committed to virtue and self-improvement, even while holding the most powerful position in the Roman Empire. 

> "The happiness of your life depends upon the quality of your thoughts: therefore, guard accordingly, and take care that you entertain no notions unsuitable to virtue and reasonable nature." - *Marcus Aurelius*

Marcus points out the direct correlation between the quality of one’s thoughts and the quality of one’s life. By reflecting, we can ensure that our thoughts align with virtue and reason.

#### Bringing Reflection into Your Daily Routine
So, how can you incorporate this practice of reflection into your own life? Here’s a simple guideline:

1. **Set aside time**: Carve out a specific time each day for reflection, ideally when you can be undisturbed.
2. **Choose a medium**: You can write in a journal, type on a computer, or even talk into a voice recorder – whichever feels most comfortable for you.
3. **Ask yourself questions**: What did I learn today? How did my actions align with my values? What can I do better?
4. **Make a commitment**: Decide on at least one actionable step you can take to improve an aspect of your life.

### Embracing Meditation: A Stoic’s Way to Inner Peace
Apart from journaling, another form of reflection that Stoicism encourages is meditation. Now, when I say meditation, I don’t necessarily mean sitting cross-legged and chanting. Stoic meditation is more about thoughtful reflection and mental exercises to cultivate self-control, rationality, and virtue.

#### Stoic Mindfulness
Stoic mindfulness is about being present and attentive to your thoughts and actions, ensuring they are in line with reason and virtue. This can be done through a simple daily practice. Take a few minutes each morning to remind yourself of the Stoic principles you want to adhere to. Likewise, in the evening, take some time to review the day, analyze your actions, and contemplate how you might improve.

#### Mental Rehearsal
Another meditation practice from the Stoic toolkit is the mental rehearsal of challenges. The idea here is to envisage different scenarios and challenges that might occur during the day and mentally practice how you would deal with them in accordance with Stoic virtues. This prepares your mind to remain calm and rational even when faced with adversity.

#### Example from Epictetus
Let’s look at an example from the renowned Stoic philosopher Epictetus. He emphasized the importance of focusing on what is within our control. This Stoic meditation involves reflecting on situations and distinguishing between what you can and cannot change. By focusing your energy and efforts only on what is within your control, you cultivate a sense of serenity and reduce anxiety.

> “Make it your regular habit to consider your roles in life and which actions are appropriate to each role. For each action, ask yourself whether it is necessary, and, if it is, whether it is the most virtuous action possible.” - *Epictetus*

#### Incorporating Stoic Meditation in Your Life
* **Begin and End the Day Thoughtfully**: Dedicate a few quiet minutes every morning and night for Stoic meditation.
* **Focus on the Present**: Throughout the day, be mindful of your thoughts and actions.
* **Engage in Mental Rehearsal**: Visualize potential challenges and your virtuous response.
* **Reflect on Control**: Regularly remind yourself of what’s in your control and release anxiety over what isn’t.

Remember that like any other skill, meditation requires practice and patience. Begin with just a few minutes a day and gradually increase as you get more comfortable with the practice.

## Stoic Routines: Starting and Ending Your Day with Wisdom
Ever feel like you’re just floating through your day, reacting instead of responding? Let’s explore how Seneca and Marcus Aurelius, used Stoic morning and evening routines to bring intention and mindfulness into their lives.

### The Morning Routine: Start Your Day with Clarity
Marcus Aurelius began his day with a mental exercise. He would remind himself that he might encounter unkind and annoying people (one of the things I love about him), but he shouldn’t let their actions disturb his tranquility.

Here’s an example of how you might put this into practice:

Imagine you’re about to head into a meeting with a coworker who’s notorious for being difficult. By anticipating this encounter and reminding yourself of your own values — patience, empathy, understanding — you can better navigate the situation without losing your cool.

### The Evening Routine: Reflect and Learn
Seneca, another influential Stoic philosopher, used an evening routine that involved reviewing his day and actions. He’d examine his behavior, both the good and the bad, and use this reflection to guide future actions. He saw this as pleading his case at his own court, where he was both the judge and the accused.

You could apply Seneca’s routine by setting aside five minutes each night to consciously recall the day’s events and review your actions. Ask yourself: “What did I do well today? What not so? How could I improve next time?”

### Self-Improvement Through Stoicism
These Stoic routines can serve as powerful tools for self-improvement and mindfulness. In the morning, your mental preparation sets the tone for the day, enabling you to respond, not react, to life’s challenges. In the evening, self-analysis fosters learning and personal growth, making you more aware of your actions.

Here’s a simple exercise to incorporate in your evening routine:

* **Good:** What did I do well today?
* **Better:** How could I improve? What could I do better?
* **Best:** What do I need to do if I want to be the best version of myself?

### A Few Words of Caution
It’s important to approach these routines with kindness and self-compassion. You’re human, after all, and some days will be better than others. Remember, the goal isn’t perfection, but continuous growth and learning.

### Embracing Stoicism in Your Daily Life
By incorporating the Stoic morning and evening routines into your daily life, you’re investing in self-growth and mindfulness. Like Epectitus, Seneca and Marcus Aurelius, you can use these routines to bring intention to your actions and foster a deeper understanding of yourself and the world around you.

## Looking Ahead: The Journey Continues
 Next month, we’ll continue our exploration by delving into the second practice – Negative Visualization. This powerful technique helps us build resilience and appreciate what we have.

Stay tuned, brethren! Our shared journey into the Stoic wisdom and its practical applications is bound to make us wiser, stronger, and more virtuous. Until next time, be well.
