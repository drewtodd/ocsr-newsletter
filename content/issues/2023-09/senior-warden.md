Greetings Brothers,
   
The Orange County Scottish Rite will be hosting their Fall 2023 reunion on Friday, October 6th and Saturday, October 7th. This is a special time for brothers to experience the lessons and philosophy of the Scottish Rite, the University of Freemasonry. It is here that newly obligated brothers begin their journey of learning the continuance of our craft, and existing brothers learn to remember and cherish.

Our degree teams are comprised of extremely dedicated brothers, who will present to you the 5 mandatory degrees (4th, 14th, 18th, 30, & 32nd). They have worked tirelessly to provide you a memorable experience.   

I will be hosting the classroom component of this journey and will be your guide throughout the reunion process, helping you to explore and understand all that which will be presented to you. It is my goal that the joint experience of classroom explanation and lodge room exemplification will assist you in building a solid foundation for the men you are destined to become.

> Reunions in general, are a time when the fraternity should form in solidarity. Even if you are a long-standing member, come on down and hang out around the Temple, reminisce, or sit-in and meditate on the profound lessons of our craft.

Reunions in general, are a time when the fraternity should form in solidarity. Even if you are a long-standing member, come on down and hang out around the Temple, reminisce, or sit-in and meditate on the profound lessons of our craft. There is always something new to learn. 

All brothers are welcome to attend the classroom segment of the reunion. Please note that the class instruction will begin at 5:30pm sharp on Friday, October 6th, and 7:00am on Saturday, October 7th. Coffee, donuts, and other miscellaneous snacks will be provided. Please be sure to wear a suit and your Scottish Rite Caps (the caps replace your aprons in lodge).

If you have any questions, please feel free to contact me.

Sincerely and fraternally,
