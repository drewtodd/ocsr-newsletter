By now, you know that we will consider a proposed dues increase at our Stated Meeting in June. The cost of operation, like the cost of everything else, has increased, and our Valley has not kept pace. Our dues - as with any Masonic body - are the basic support of the organization, and should cover our operational budget, while activities can be self-funding. The reality is that our dues are, at present, insufficient to cover our expenses, and although we are gradually growing, it is time for each of us to contribute their share in support of our Valley. We look forward to seeing many of you turn out in support of this proposal.

Fraternally and sincerely,
