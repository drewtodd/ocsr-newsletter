Brethren: Our Spring Reunion begins at 6pm on June 10th Friday and resumes at 7am on June 11th Saturday. It is being held with the Valley of Long Beach at the Long Beach Scottish Rite Temple at 855 Elm Avenue. Please try to come by one day to watch a few degrees. We have a good group of candidates who should  make excellent Brothers. Our June Stated Meeting will be held at the DeMolay Center on Wednesday, June 6th at 6:30pm.  **We will be holding our vote on a necessary increase in our annual dues from $105/year to $120/year. This increase will not go in to effect until the 2024 dues year.** The 2023 dues notices that Supreme will be mailing out in July will still be at the $105/year level.

It is good to remember that membership and participation in the Ancient and Accepted Scottish Rite is a privilege for Master Masons. The 29 Degrees of the Scottish Rite expound and clarify our understanding of the Blue Lodge Degrees. Through an improved understanding of Masonic principles, we can make more positive contributions to our families and our communities. This is the consummation of the Masonic adage, “Take a good man and make him better.” 

If we don’t take advantage of participating in Valley activities, we are only short changing our own Masonic development. We have a wide range of participation opportunities available. With Stated Meetings & Reunions, Master Craftsmen classes, Degree teams and General help (set-up for meetings, etc.) , each Brother can find a way to contribute that suits his inclination and availability.
 
Please inform the office if you know of a Brother in sickness or distress. Finally, we wish an enjoyable Summer for you and your families.
 
Fraternally,
