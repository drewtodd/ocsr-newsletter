Welcome back to the RiteCare Childhood Language Center of Orange County.  Summer is here and the children are ready for a glorious California summer.

Summer trimester started off at the beach! Children were delighted to be greeted with beach balls hanging from the ceiling and therapy materials highlighting the ocean, the beach and summer activities ready to go.  Chapman University does not miss a trick to use current activities, like holidays or seasons, to inspire the children with their language development.

Jordan is as happy as a clam with the summer themed materials! Summer session is only 8 weeks long and the clinicians and kids working hard to make progress in that short amount of time. Specifically, Jordan is working on the “L” sound, and he proudly stated – “I like the beach!”

Maverick is intrigued with finding items in a container of rice – when he finds one, he needs to say his “p” sound 3 times.

As you can tell, Elijah is very happy to be here so he can work on his pronouns – he, she, and they! 

We also welcomed a new experienced supervisor to our Center – Leslie Walker. 

Happy Summer Everyone!
