We are told that our time should be measured in three equal parts - one third for work, one third for refreshment, and one third for service.

One third for service.  I ask myself, do I really measure up?  Unfortunately, I do not. 

One third for service is a lot - 8 hours/day, 30 days in a month - that's 240 hours each month! 

{{% figure src="img/image.png" alt="" class="right medium border shadow rotate-clockwise"%}}

If I include the time I spend driving to and from Lodge, I spend about three hours each month.

If I include the time I spend doing work for the CLC, there's another two-ish hours.

If I include the time I spend mentoring and working with non-profits, there's about 20 hours.
 
So, out of the 240 hours for service, I'm somewhere around 25... if I round up.

I can tell myself that times are different now - that the 8 hour work day has stretched to be closer to 12 hours.  That working remotely makes it easy for work to slip into my "off" hours, that I need more than 8 hours to unwind, eat, sleep, and generally refresh myself after those long work days... and that leaves me less time for service.

On the other hand, I am a Mason because I want to improve myself - I want to be a better man, a better husband, a better citizen, a better human being in service to my fellow man and the Great Architect.

When I work, can I dedicate a portion of our time to considering how my efforts make things better for others?  When I sit down to dinner with friends and family, can I inculcate them with a sense of charity? Can I, in my daily life, find little opportunities to extend a hand in fellowship and brotherly love to not only my Brethren, but to humanity as a whole?

These little items add up - a few minutes here, half an hour there - at the end of the day I've found another hour or two for the service column of my daily ledger... and suddenly, that 25 hours becomes 50... or 75.  Still not 240 hours, but I'm getting closer.

Masonry provides us with tools to improve. By using those tools, I can strive for perfection, even knowing that as an imperfect being I may never achieve it. Will I ever find that perfect balance?  That symmetrical division of my hours?  Perhaps not, but I will keep trying.
