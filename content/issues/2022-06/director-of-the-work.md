Brethren, 

We’re finally here! Reunion time... **June 10 and 11 at the Long Beach Scottish Rite Temple**. Another joint Reunion, and we’ve got a huge collective class to introduce between several Valleys! In advance, I’d love to thank the Brothers who have stood up to help out with this whole process in service of the new Scottish Rite Brethren joining our Valley. 

What I would love to see is a few of your faces as we help put on the 4th Degree, our 14th Degree team will be on hand to present that, as well as the 31st Degree. 

I hope that anyone available can come and hang out and support the new Brothers! Can’t wait to see you at the next Stated Meeting! 

Fraternally,
