### Memento Mori

Well, this month's theme is "Time", and there's not a lot I have to say about that. Except that you only get so much of it before you depart this beautiful, wicked old world. So, as Ben Franklin so sagely advised, it's best not to squander it.

It's a time-honored Masonic tradition (see what I did there) to ponder one's own death and the great hearafter. And it's important to use your resources wisely; this would most certainly include making the most of the time that you have.

How we do this is, of course, entirely personal. Maybe a few more hours trawling Facebook? A few pints of midnight oil at the office chasing deadlines? Spending time with our families. Enjoying the good of this world and not letting the bad bother us too much. The choice is ours.

And now all this talk of time and waste has got me nostalgic. So I'll leave you all with a favorite poem -- lyrics to a song, actually -- with which you may or may not be familiar. Either way, it was written in 1972 by a Brit who, upon turning twenty-nine years old realized that his life was speeding past and he was taking it for granted. He'd also lost his best friend to mental illness and was having a hard time dealing with it. It is, appropriately, entitled "Time".

<blockquote>
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day  <br>
Fritter and waste the hours in an off-hand way

Kicking around on a piece of ground in your home town  
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way

Tired of lying in the sunshine staying home to watch the rain  
You are young and life is long and there is time to kill today  
And then the one day you find ten years have got behind you  
No one told you when to run, you missed the starting gun  

And you run and you run to catch up with the sun but it's sinking  
Racing around to come up behind you again  

The sun is the same in a relative way but you're older  
Shorter of breath and one day closer to death  

Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time  
Plans that either come to naught or half a page of scribbled lines  
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way  
The time is gone the song is over thought I'd something more to say  

Home, home again  
I like to be here when I can  

When I come home cold and tired  
It's good to warm my bones beside the fire  

Far away across the field, the tolling on the iron bell  
Calls the faithful to their knees, to hear the softly spoken magic spell... 
</blockquote>

Be well, brothers.
