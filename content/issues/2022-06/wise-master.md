Greetings Brethren,

While experiencing mental fatigue of late (I blame it on the baby), I decided to adjust my writing approach a bit and review what Honorable Brother Michael J. Sekera wrote in The Road Less Traveled to help summarize and perhaps button up the 16th degree (at the very least add some perspective). The ‘Mythic Journey’ extends from the Ineffable Degrees (4th – 14th) of the Lodge, building upon the Law of Love expressed in earlier articles and progresses into the lessons of the Chapter. The 16th degree shines a light on a bright example of the application of Masonic virtues (love, peace, charity, and toleration) exemplified in real time with a conversation between Zerubbabel and Darius on the very sensitive topic of impartial justice (only God can judge) in attempting to negotiate the rebuilding of the Temple. This provides for Albert Pike’s assertion that we all have the ability to act righteous despite difficulties all around us and perhaps somewhat explains Darius’ agreeability in Zerubbabel’s desires.

The 16th degree extends the lessons of the 15th degree and emphasizes the belief that God aids those who pursue good works while applying the virtue of wisdom (being in possession of knowledge is not enough). Specifically, to know and understand the lofty truths of philosophy, and to communicate it freely to others (on the level), particularly by our actions. Our actions being in the form or exercise of labor is vital in everyday life as it extends the opportunities in teaching us. Simply rising and eating only to later lay down and rest is not enough. For God has ordained work shall be done in all dwellings of life and of which Pike examines righteousness. Said another way, everything acts upon and influences us.

This takes us to the inner workings of the “human heart, and as Pike would agree, the beauty of love, the charm of friendship, the sacredness of sorrow, the heroism of patience, the noble self-sacrifice, these and their like, alone, make life to be life indeed and are its grandeur and its power” [Sekera]. Summarizing beautifully that every Mason the laboring man our peer and that all of Masonry is work. As we enter the dog days of summer, this tired father (yours truly) could use some rest.

In our calls to the Almoner, remember Brethren: He who giveth to charity, lendeth to the Lord.

Sincerely & Fraternally,
