“If the past really did already happen then where did it all go after all?" 

It took me a while to write this up because I had to actually search up information on time since it’s such a complicated subject. In my search for truth I found out some interesting perspectives. 

Time is the master of all everything has a beginning and an end. What’s in between beginning and end is time. Time is like a big tree that has a hold on everything or sort of like a tree of life. The branches are like galaxies in space. Each branch starts on its own time. It grows then that branch’s time is over when it has grown long enough or it’s leaves fall and you have to trim them. Then a new point in time has started for evolution.

So many of us calculate time in our lives and forget that all we have is now. Past or future doesn’t exist. Most of what happened to us is to some kind of cause and effect. We should all accept that we are all experiencing light only for so long and should not take it for granted. If time wasn’t a topic of conversation imagine how much more you would accomplish in your day and how much of it you would actually try to enjoy. 

I don’t think time really exists unless you want to calculate travel or how long it is before you have to clock out. Ahaha I’ve also had another perspective about time. What if time was an invisible magnet that sucks energy out of matter until it decays? Or is it some kind of g-force that’s sucking energy out of our bodies at the rate of spend the earth moves? 

It’s an interesting thought. If I could time travel I would like to do go back to ancient time and become some kind of warrior or leader of an army or a knight. I would also like to travel back in time to ancient Egypt. There’s so many artifacts and symbolic things there I wish I could experience what the thought process was and how or who built the pyramids. 

In the mean time, while we figure out how to time travel. Don’t worry about yesterday or next year just except the experiences that come with who you desire to be and where you go, let’s make the best of this moment! 

Take care,
