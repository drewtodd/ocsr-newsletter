**Time**: A simple noun-  “The indefinite, continued progress of existence and events in the past, present, and future regarded as a whole,” according to the Google dictionary.

The great equalizer is time.  We all only get so much time and no one knows how much we will have.  People can always acquire more money but you can’t really “buy” more time.  It is so vital that we all put the right value on our time and make the best choices on how we will spend it.

Hopefully I have spent my time wisely.  During the past 29 years, I married my wife Deni and together we have raised two great kids.

But being a dad and a husband has also had its challenges, all of which have left us with some wonderful memories once we made our way through them.  The time we have spent together as as a family has made us so much closer Even  though my kids are now young adults, we all still enjoy spending time together - the best reward of all.

Now a days, I spend most of my time with my wife and friends.  Since I still have more time I’m going to keep making more good memories!
