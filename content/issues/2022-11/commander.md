It's that time of year again, when we gather with family and friends, prepare copious amounts of food, and -- in a post-meal-tryptophan-enduced-stupor -- turn inward to thoughts of, among other things:

Giving thanks.

With that in mind, things I am thankful for:


{{% figure src="img/thankful.jpeg" alt="" class="full border shadow" %}}
- An amazing wife, who puts up with me
- Two awesome daughters, who have renewed my sense of wonder
- A dog, who teaches me patience on a daily basis
- Brethren, who help me be a better husband and father
- Duct tape, which holds the universe together
- Sufficient food, which is a blessing not available to all 
- Clean water, which is a blessing available to fewer still
- RiteCare, and the opportunity to help others
- Naps, which I hated as a child, but have growth to love
- Weekends, which I don't take advantage of as much as I should
- Thanksgiving... and not being the turkey
- Internet access, which keeps us all connected
- Hot water, which makes showers infinitely better
- Education, which lifts us from ignorance
- Teachers, who help us in so many ways
- Entertainment, which saves us from boredom
- Mistakes, for providing us the opportunity to learn
- Books, which offer us a way to store the wisdom of the past
- Opposable thumbs... and two thumbs up
- Toilet paper (enough said)
- Fingernails... and the ability to scratch itches
- Gratitude... and the ability to be thankful
- You, the reader of this.  I am thankful that you are here - my life would be less rich without you.

What are YOU thankful for?
