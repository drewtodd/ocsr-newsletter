Brethren: We will be holding our Stated Meeting at 6:30 pm at the DeMolay Center on Monday, October 3rd. Once again, we will be serving a tasty dinner following our meeting. If you haven't attended an OCSR meeting for some time, now is an excellent time to return. 

Finally, please contact the office if you have any questions regarding your dues status. Our Fall Reunion is coming up in November. Please tell your Blue Lodge Brothers about our Valley. Petitions are available on our Valley website. Have an outstanding month.

Fraternally,
