Welcome back to the RiteCare Childhood Language Center of Orange County!  October is spooky season!  No, not spooky to be at the clinic or working with our families, but a time when we get to partake in fun activities, decorate the clinic and even dress up at the end of the month.  The clinic has been full of all the festivities, and everyone has been taking part in the fun. 

This month, we saw an increase in children being assessed and added to our schedules.  We have also been able to see some amazing progress from our children who have been with us for a while.  Not only have the children grown in their progress, but the students have been learning so much as well. Being able to witness all the positivity and learning that happens from week to week is a true joy. 

We have continued to have a very smooth transition of clinic managers.  Leslie Walker has continued to make positive changes to build on the work Chris Switzer started.  Every supervisor and student is grateful for how easily this was completed, and it could not have been accomplished without everyone working together as a team.  No scares there!

This month, we have been able to aid children in saying their first words, getting additional support beyond speech and language and we have helped children finally conquer that challenging “r” sound!  In honor of the spookiness of the season, we have been scaring away speech and language challenges that have tried to keep our kids down. 

We hope each of you have been able to enjoy the festivities of this season and are looking forward to the ones coming. 

Sincerely,
