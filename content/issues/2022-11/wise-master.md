Greeting Brethren,

As mentioned over the last few months, the Chapter Degrees are not only some of the most beautiful displays of wisdom in all of Masonry but are also written about at length and dissected regularly in various research reports and journals across the Craft.

My home Valley in Boston, Massachusetts advertises the 18° as the new law of love [Mount Olivet]. “We should prepare a temple in our heart, where God is worshipped.” The Scottish Rite Journal of Freemasonry (Southern Jurisdiction) frequently publishes articles on the Chapter. In March/April we read the article Describing The Ineffable Part 1: INRI by Andy Albright, 32° KCCH, “We begin with curiosity about the mysterious inscription INRI. An abbreviation(s) composed of four letters, interpretations of the term vary greatly.”

In John 19:19 we remember the Christian translation of the Latin Vulgate Iesus Nazarenus Rex Iudaeorum or Jesus of Nazareth, King of the Jews. The sages of antiquity codified this into Igne Natura Renovatur Integra or All of Nature is Regenerated by Fire as said in Morals and Dogma (Knight Rose Croix). There is an alchemical interpretation, a Hebrew understanding, and even a Jesuit ascription that reads Justum Necare Reges Impios, it is just to exterminate impious kings, governments, or rulers. All interpretations are unique and personal doubting not that even deeper learnings exist among minds of Masons.

In July/August we read the article Vested in Glory: The Path of the Initiate as Heroic Quest by Lucas M. Walsh, 32° about “the purpose of the journey of the Chapter of Rose Croix is to fan that spark into a flame and to make it the center of our lives and interactions with others.” Illustrious Jim Tresner, 33°, G.C. is quoted in the same article “that the death of ego is imperative to the success of the mythic journey, or the quest of the ages, and this overcoming of ego is far from easy. As for the goal of the journey, if an initiate truly acts out the philosophy of Freemasonry, he becomes the living embodiment of the symbols he studies, or, rather, he becomes that which they represent.”

I appreciate and give Thanks to Freemasonry, that the whole symbolic system of the Rite itself, being a guide to rule our actions in life. To inculcate our system is to sharpen our skills within its bounds, with brethren nearby who stand ready to assist, is personal to me, something profound and valuable, worthy of Thanksgiving, which I am proud to belong.

In our calls to the Almoner, remember Brethren: He who giveth to charity, lendeth to the Lord.


Sincerely & Fraternally,
