Of all the sweat and tears you’ve counted drip down your cheeks have you ever took a moment to count your blessings? Are you more aware of what you don’t have than what you do? Maybe it’s time to take a deep breathe and exhale all the doubts away. 

It’s very important to focus on the smallest of details in our lives so that we are thankful for the more grand opportunities god has blessed our world with. Social media has really affected peoples lives and society as a whole. Everyday it seems people are more Interested in what Bob or Pedro are laughing at which are two completely different people on different sides of the country. Instead of making our brothers laugh or mothers laugh or learning what it is that actually amused them. To simply listen to them talk about their muses. I can’t remember last time I went to a bonfire sat around and heard scaries stories. It’s like we’ve all been hypnotized by our phones and what we think we need to see. Well we’ve got to get back to family friendships and community before we start considering our phones “best friend”. 

Appreciation of our first breath in the morning, being able to open our eyes, being able to talk and walk out of bed for some of us, should be the beginning stages or steps of becoming more thankful for our days on this planet. Every day we should bow our heads at night and give thanks to our God and the universe for another chance at this experience. Counting your steps, smiling at your self in the mirror, hugging a little kid before they go to school, it’s the little things the little blessings in life that will humble us and allow us to be thankful and be more giving so others receive the same blessings. 

Being thankful is one of the secrets to life and true happiness. I’m so thankful I’ve had enough to say in all my news letters. :) Thank you all who took the time to read my monthly input. 


Fraternally,
