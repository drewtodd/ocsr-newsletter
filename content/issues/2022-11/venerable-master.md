Thankfulness

With the Thanksgiving Holiday on the near horizon it is a good time to reflect and remember to be thankful for all the goodness in our lives.

The Thanksgiving Holiday is widely celebrated in the US with our traditions of a big Turkey dinner and watching Football games on the television.  I guess shopping is also becoming part of the tradition.  Other countries also have their version of the Thanksgiving holiday.

Canada also celebrates Thanksgiving which is very much the sale as the US holiday.  The big difference is the Canadian holiday is celebrated on the second Monday in October.

In Europe some German speaking countries like Germany, Austria and Switzerland celebrate more religious holiday called Erntedankfest.  This celebration is a more public festival celebration in early October with parades and church activities.  The holiday started as a way to give thanks for a good Autumn Harvest.

The Caribbean country of Grenada started a Thanksgiving holiday on the 25th of October.  The country celebrates the return of freedom and democracy after a coup attempt in 1983 when the prime minister was assassinated. The United States military invaded Grenada to restore law and order.  

Japan celebrates Labor Thanksgiving Day in late November to give thanks for the Shinto rice harvest.

Liberia celebrates the American Thanksgiving holiday.  As a former US Colony the country officially adopted the holiday in the 1880’s and declared their independence in 1947.

The United Kingdom has a Harvest Festival in late September or early October.  This holiday dates back to pre-christian times and gives thanks for a good harvest with a family meal.

I am very thankful to serve as the Venerable Master this year and to spend this time with all of you.  Give your loved ones a big hug and give thanks for the time you have together.

Sincerely,
