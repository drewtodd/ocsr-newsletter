One of the enduring subjects of Freemasonry is the importance of contemplating our mortality - not as a morbid subject, but as a continuing reminder that life is fleeting, and that each of us should consider both the quality of the life we live and the memory we leave behind when we leave. We see this in the three Blue Lodge degrees as well as the degrees of the Scottish Rite. Masonry teaches the simple truth that this contemplation is not just for those of advanced age, but that even the youngest Mason should stop and consider the brevity of human existence and the nature of their legacy.

The principle of Masonic charity is closely tied to our mortality, since the gifts we make will be a part of the memory we leave. We all champion our RiteCare Language Center, and I hope that you make a contribution to its support, whether through the California Scottish Rite Foundation or the Orange County Scottish Rite Foundation. Of course, there are many other Masonic philanthropies, and I hope you support one or more of them as well. Remember that every gift makes a difference.
