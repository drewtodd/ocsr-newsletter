If you'd like to participate or are looking for information about the program, please prepare by [visiting the official website](https://scottishrite.org/scottish-rite-master-craftsman-program/) for information about the books and other information to get you started:

## The Master Craftsman Program
For those unaware, the Scottish Rite Master Craftsman (SRMC) program is an exciting, correspondence course designed and administered by staff at the House of the Temple in Washington, DC, under the guidance and leadership of the Supreme Council, 33°, of the A&A Scottish Rite, Southern Jurisdiction, USA. All three courses are available as mail-in courses or online.

Starting in February, we will begin covering the quizzes from both the Symbolic Logic and the Scottish Rite History and Ritual programs, alternating each month. This will allow you to get through both programs in a timely fashion, and help ensure that all bases are covered.

We will be meeting in the “virtual classroom” on Zoom this month. Join us on Monday, Feburary 8th at 5:00pm as we continue our progress through the Master Craftsman program. Stay tuned for an email invite, coming soon.

If you’re just getting started we can also help you with Quizzes #1 - 3.  You can also reach out to me directly for information and access to our Facebook group.

Thanks to all our brothers for your interest and participation. I’ll see you in the classroom!
