Greetings, Brethren!

For those of you who have not yet heard... I'm the guy you want to know. 

Because I'm your Brother?  Nope - you have thousands of Brothers within the Fraternity.  Because I'm a good cook? Nope - although I get no complaints from my wife.  Because I'm a funny guy?  Maybe, but there are plenty of funny guys in Masonry.

No, Brethren, the reason you want to know me is simple... You want to know me because I'm looking for volunteers to help us do some fundraising.
 
Wait. What?  Why on earth would you want to know the guy who wants to put you to work?
 
For a few simple reasons:

1. It's to support the Childhood Language Center
2. It's part of our oath, to loyally support our charities
3. It's a fashion show fundraiser and it means you'll get to hang out with models.

Yes, Brethren, I've been producing fashion shows as fundraisers for many, many years and I'm looking for a few good Brothers who want to hang out with smoking hot models help support the kids with a fundraising event.
 
No matter your skills, we have a volunteer role for you.  We need everything from ticket takers to graphic designers, social media gurus to caterers - if you want to help, we'll put you to work.
 
By the way, if you haven't joined the KSA yet, now would be an EXCELLENT time to do so - I can tell you from my past experience producing these shows in San Francisco that all of the ladies want to get their picture taken on the red carpet... especially with the guys in the kilts.

Want to help?  Drop me a line at todd@quantimark.com and let me know where your talents lie - I'll put you in touch with the appropriate team chair.
