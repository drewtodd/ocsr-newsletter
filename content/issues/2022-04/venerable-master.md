## The Renewal of the Face

As the dark scary cloud of COVID is being lifted we can now see the renewal of the beautiful smiling face. Before Covid most of us would never consider wearing a mask into the bank. Only robbers would cover their faces to protect their identity. During Covid banks and many businesses required you to wear a mask, reversing decades of requirements that you must show your face. Didn’t it feel weird to put on a mask to enter the bank?
 
Is this guy a bank robber or a customer? Turns out he was a robber, but the bank employees could not hear his demands for money through the mask. He left the bank empty handed.

For the last couple of months, I’ve been meeting at a new bank to open an account. The whole time all the employees were wearing a mask. I would also wear a mask out of respect for their health and safety, it seemed like the right thing to do. I visited the bank last week and to my surprise most of the masks were gone. It suddenly occurred to me that I could see these nice faces of people who I’ve been speaking to for months. It is great to see people smiling again.

Researchers have concluded that masks affect the way we recognize people. In 2020 a group of scientists conducted a study with 239 participants to see how COVID masking requirements would impact people’s ability to perceive faces. Of course, they concluded that mask decrease our ability to recognize people. Another interesting outcome is that covering faces leads to an increase in social disengagement, a decrease in social confidence and a general decrease in quality of life. We all know that COVID was bad, but this just confirms our suspicions.  

In other words, we need to see each other’s faces, hopefully with a smile. We need to see the faces of other people as we go through our daily lives.    

We should all embrace the renewal of the face by attending lodge and showing off your great smile! I hope to see you at the lodge soon.
