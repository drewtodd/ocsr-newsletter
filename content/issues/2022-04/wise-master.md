Greetings Brethren,

April is upon us and with that, we begin the second quarter of our Scottish Rite year. I like to take this time and reflect upon or renew the commitments made from our New Year’s Resolutions and if necessary, tweak or adjust as necessary. Personally, I have been chasing the same 15 pounds since college, promising to moderate my affection towards beer, drink less coke zero, and to read more regularly. Freemasonry provides us an excellent system of ‘check-ins’ and introspections to milestone our progress, trade off where inappropriate or occasionally, abandon all together. A beautiful framework of morality that begins within our ability to hold ourselves accountable. I would say that I am sufficiently making progress. “There is no try,” as Grand Master Yoda said it. 

The sixteenth degree or Prince of Jerusalem takes place in the Court of Zerubbabel, Governor of Judah (representing Jerusalem), within the council-chamber of the king of Persia (representing Babylon), and the country or passage that separates the two empires. The degree builds upon the lessons taught in the preceding degree with a particular emphasis on the virtues of faithfulness and wisdom as exemplified on the belief that God aids those who pursue a good work. Holiness to the Lord.

The Second Temple was completed by Zerubbabel in the sixth year of the reign of Darius (following more than four centuries after the original completion of King Solomon’s Temple) and it’s rebuilding was not exactly smooth (which we will discuss in more detail in the next couple of months). But essentially, our rank and dignity as Masons is attained through courteous, kind, and just Masonic labor. In the closing of the degree, we are reminded that during our rest from our labors, our God has extended mercy unto us, given us new life, that He may make us to prosper. 

I’d like to thank the brethren for their support during my temporary absence as well as all the shout outs, emails, and texts of encouragement. Our third child, Norah was born to us on Saturday, March 5th to a happy and welcoming home. I had the honor of delivering her myself, with my other two kids present here in our home. My wife, Nastasia is recovering nicely. I’ll probably miss our April meeting as we march ourselves into some of the tough and tiring weeks ahead. Mind you, my older kiddos have come to expect a certain quality of life that our third cannot interrupt. :smile:

In our calls to the Almoner, remember Brethren: He who giveth to charity, lendeth to the Lord.

Sincerely & Fraternally,
