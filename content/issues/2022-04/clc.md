Welcome back to the RiteCare Childhood Language Center of Orange County.  Spring is here and so many of our students have an extra bounce in their step!  



Our student clinicians continue to gain valuable experience evaluating new clients, engaging in therapy, and providing parent coaching to the caregivers of some of our youngest clients.  Parent coaching can provide more opportunities for our young students to learn because caregivers learn how to interpret and respond to their child's attempts to communicate.  They also learn how to create more opportunities for their child to communicate outside of the therapy room and how to play and sing with their child in a way that supports their child’s language and communication development.

The parents of two-year-old Daniel recently learned new strategies to support his understanding and use of language during his evaluation with us. They returned for therapy the following week and exclaimed, "We have been practicing the strategies you shared with us and they work!"  Daniel, who was quite cautious when we first met him, arrived at his therapy session with a big smile and was excited to "play" with his parents and his clinician, Allie.

Other children are enjoying articulation and language lessons that involve spring concepts such as baby farm animals, gardening, and creepy, crawly bugs.  Some of our young clients are learning to identify baby animals and imitate animal sounds.  Other kids are having fun collecting 'chicken eggs' that they open to find new words that allow them to practice their speech sounds.  Many of the children whom we serve are enjoying books that allow them to learn about spring concepts while they learn new speech and language skills.  It's so much fun to walk through the center and hear the sounds of happy children and clinicians!   

We truly appreciate all your support which makes these great stories possible.  The OC Valley is making hope possible for all of these families and beautiful children.

Sincerely,
