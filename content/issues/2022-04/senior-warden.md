Renewal. That's the theme of this month's newsletter, and it comes at a fitting moment. We as a society are beginning to emerge from our pandemic-imposed cocoons and life is getting back to normal. But it's not as easy as it seems for everyone.

There has been much coverage of our collective trepidation in returning to life after Covid. **NPR** asks "[Do We Even Know How To Socialize Anymore?][1]" **Psychology Today** has tips for "[Reconnecting After COVID-19][2]." Across the pond, the **BBC** queries, "[Is going 'back to normal' even possible?][3]"

There's a lot of stress and uncertainty out there.

This applies to many of the things we loved and looked forward to, pre-pandemic: Going out to restaurants, bars, and gyms; sitting on crowded public transportation; boarding an airplane. Who wants to go on a cruise right about now (although, trust me, I'm sure you can get a deal)?

Still, this is it. We've crossed an invisible threshold. New virus variants be damned, society is determined to push forward and wrench "normal" from the hands of extraordinary times. It's time to get back to living life, even if it means accepting a certain amount of risk.

But isn't that what living life is about anyway? Who doesn't risk serious injury in a car accident, or food poisoning when ordering the clams, or getting run over by an errant bus -- every single time we leave the house? Even in the before-times.

Life isn't death and taxes; it's risk and change.

In late March, my mother-in-law celebrated her 100th birthday. Leading up to this event my wife and I vowed to take every precaution, so as not to put her at risk of missing this historic personal milestone -- one of which is extremely proud. This included not going out into situations where we might pick up the virus and -- unwittingly -- give it to her.

I'm happy to report that Evelyn Esola Wilkinson's centenial celebration arrived with proper fanfare (and princess cake).

I know that some of you may have missed my presence in the past couple of Stated Meetings, and this was the reason. I apologize for any inconvenience I may have caused my brothers in missing my appointed duties and I promise that I'll be around for the nine meetings we have left. I'll contribute. I'll re-emerge, renewed.

And I look forward to getting back to some kind of normal. A renewed normal that might look a little different than the old normal, but normal nonetheless.

I look forward to seeing you all, to sharing a smile and a story, to rebuilding the bonds of brotherhood.

I hope to see you on the first Monday of April, and often thereafter.

Be well, brothers.
