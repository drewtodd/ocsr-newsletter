Brethren: A very Happy New Year to all of the Brothers of the Valley of Orange County. The Valley office was busy in the last months of 2023 with dues payments. We want to thank all of the Brothers who have paid their 2024 dues. Our Stated Meeting for January will be on January 8th at 6:30 pm. An improvement in the quality of meals served at our meals following our Stated Meetings has helped lead to better attendance. Combined with speakers at dinner, our Stated Meeting nights have more fellowship than ever. 

Also in January, we will be holding our Annual Installation of Officers for the year. This is a great ceremony that is open to family and friends. Please make a point of attending as you will enjoy it. An email will be coming with the exact date and time. 
  
The start of a new year is a good time to evaluate your Masonic commitments. Are you participating in the Scottish Rite of Orange County at a level that yields results that you expect? Now is a great time to begin attending Valley events (Meetings, Reunions, Installations etc.) that you may have missed in 2023. 
  
After our December Stated Meeting, we had our annual Christmas party for the kids receiving treatment at our Childhood Language Center. We had a large turnout from the Brethren. Overall, we had well over 100 people attend the dinner. Santa Claus made an appearance and distributed presents to the kids. 
  
Finally, we wish a healthy & prosperous New Year to all Scottish Rite Masons and your families.

Sincerely and Fraternally,
