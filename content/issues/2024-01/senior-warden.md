## Tiyoweh and the Journey of the 13 Moons
{{< figure src="img/zia-symbol.png" class="right medium border shadow" alt="The Zia Symbol" caption="The Zia Symbol" >}}

There was a time when I lived in the desert and secluded myself from the “Western” World. There I befriended a shaman through the several esoteric circles with whom I had involved myself. I endeavored quests and received healing from the elders. It was truly a transformative experience with the Pueblo Tribes of New Mexico. Of the many, the Zia (Anasazi) who are most known for their pottery and use of the Sun symbol, had a deep impression upon my heart.

Since my time in the Chihuahuan Desert ecoregion, I have held the Zia symbol as sacred, for its many meanings, and what I have come to know as its half-representation as an indigenous Yin Yang principle (I’ll cover this more in depth throughout the year). 

Catherine Saez’s interview with Anthony Delgarito, the Governor of the Pueblo of Zia, provides a glimpse into its meaning. 

> “The Zia sun symbol represents the four cardinal directions, the four seasons of the year, the four periods of each day (morning, noon, evening, and night), and the four seasons of life (childhood, youth, middle age, and old age). The center of the sun symbol stands for life itself.”

There are also four sacred obligations of the Zia; develop a strong body, a clear mind, a pure spirit, and a devotion to the welfare of one’s people. Across a multitude of religions and philosophies, I have found meditation to achieve that end. It is interesting, however, that in the Western world, to meditate means to contemplate on a thought, while in Eastern philosophy, meditation is the act or willingness to clear one’s mind of all thoughts. 

In Shamanism (the way of the North & South) Tiyoweh (“tieyo-way”), a Native American word, means the Stillness, and refers to the internal quiet by which we commune with nature in order to achieve the state of being grounded, centered, and in the moment.

In an article by Marianne Goldweber, she states that the world as we know it, has become “angry and loud,” a sort of assault on the senses. 

“When watching TV, the commercials are much louder than the shows. The strobe-like visuals. The raw sexual and violent content of the programming and ads. Things are getting louder, to get our attention. We are numb and seemingly immune. Until you turn it off and desensitize.”

Given the new year and the current climate, I felt that sharing this esoteric connection of de-sensitization appropriate for manifesting a healthy new beginning. In it, we will find a new energy; a rebirth for new beginnings.

As Masons, we too hold sacred the meanings behind North, South, East and West. In the Orange County Scottish Rite, Venerable Master Andrew Todd, 32° has guided us to an understanding of self-mastery through what could be referred to as the Romanized perspective of Western philosophical thought; Stoicism. In 2024, I will endeavor to share influences from the Eastern tradition of Taoism, and the Northern & Southern influences of Norse Shamanism and Shamanism of the indigenous Americas. The combined wisdom of all 4 directions setting a theme, represented through 2024’s symbolism of the Zia or “Light” from the Sun God.

In order to share this light, I thought it might be interesting to provide a structure for participating in an ancient tradition of aligning the self to lunar calendars. 

Oral history tells us that in ancient times, mankind would call upon the spirit of the 13 wisdom keepers to aid them on their journey towards light and love. These wisdom keepers or Clan Mothers are said to be the physical manifestation of Earth Mother on the terrestrial plain. The tradition purports that each Clan Mother was invested with a purpose from the divine, and that each one offered talents, strengths, and abilities, and that these traits could be called upon by anyone who chose to develop them. The way in which we connect with them is through meditation, or Tiyoweh. This is symbolized as the Medicine Wheel of the thirteen Clan Mothers.

Although not a traditional legend particular to one tribe, it is the shared belief among the indigenous of the Americas, that there once was one continent, referred to as Turtle Island. The Sacred Turtle was the embodiment of Earth Mother. Its protective shell was her 13 wisdom keepers (with their lunar cycles depicted on each plate), who protect the planet and all its inhabitants. The Turtle symbol can be found in many of the America’s great traditions, i.e. the Turtle Temples of the Mayans in the Yucatan, or as painted frescos in the Toltec and Inca places of worship, or carved in petroglyphs across North America, all representatives of the Earth Mother and her 13 different aspects; the 13 Original Clan Mothers.

In Seneca Nation teachings, they have what is referred to as the Twelve Cycles of Truth. Each month explores aspects of the nature of truth i.e.  Learn the Truth, Honor the Truth, Accept the Truth, etc.  A thirteenth cycle has been added (“Be the Truth”) to complete the medicine wheel. The Medicine Wheel and the Cycle of Truths have been combined as the **Journey of the 13 Moons**. Each month, we will reflect on an aspect of identifying the Truth (in ourselves).

January 2024 will begin our first moon of reflection: “Talks with Relations.” This is an introduction to Mother Nature, the bearer of all life. She teaches us to understand the unspoken languages of Nature, kinship with all lifeforms and how to enter sacred spaces of others with respect. How to honor cycles, rhythms, and changes of the seasons and weather. How to meld with the life force and rhythms in all dimensions, learning the truths of each. We are taught How to LEARN THE TRUTH.

I ask that in the Moon of January, you contemplate “What is Truth? And how will you endeavor to learn it (hint: Take some time to sit in nature, become your environment, and meditate).

Aho,
