Though our Fraternity is founded in tradition, we cannot dismiss the value of change - so long as it is a positive evolution. Freemasons build upon the accomplishments of those who precede us, just as the operative mason places a new stone upon the existing one to erect a useful building. We have seen much change in our Valley this past year, with the evolution of Valley leadership, advances in the Language Center program, and in almost a matter of days, the installation of our new officers. This is a good time to contemplate our future, and to thank those who have cleared the path we now follow.

I encourage each of you to consider your role in our Valley and the role our Valley plays in our community. The Rite calls itself the college of Freemasonry, and this can be true - we have a very vibrant program of Masonic Education in Orange County. But to fill that role, we also need both faculty and students, which means our Valley needs to begin to grow and to engage existing members while appealing to new ones. Our strategic plan was initially proposed in November, and will continue to develop during the new year. It calls for our Valley to assume the role of Orange County's Masonic gathering place, where the members of the 13 lodges in our county can fellowship and learn from one another, as well as teach one another.

I look to the new year as one of  opportunity, challenge and excitement, and I look forward to seeing each of you - along with your spouse or partner - in the very near future. And when you see me, take a moment to share a bit about you, your Masonic journey, and your thoughts about what you'd like to see our Valley offer. Every day holds the promise of a new beginning, built on the foundation of the day before. Join me as together we build our future.

Sincerely and fraternally,
