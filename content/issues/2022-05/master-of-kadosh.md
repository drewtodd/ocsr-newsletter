Greetings brethren, 

Isn’t it funny that the word Family is so powerful? Like the word family can be used to divide people by making you in a way selfish. “This is mine and that’s yours and you can’t touch mine or I’ll hurt you.” Haha The word family can easily just mean a group of people in a specific location together. Family can be literally the people that brought you into this world and designed (raised) you. 

I guess where Im getting at is that Family is a very powerful word that can give someone so much hope and motivation! Growing up I didn’t have immediate family to call over or go visit any day of the week because of distance. To me family has always been people I socialized with, a teammate, coworker, or neighbor. Which I think has helped me develop an understanding for humanity instead of just a certain group that I think is important or I should put above all else.

Family I’ve learned is a group of people who are willing to invest a certain amount of time into your life dedicated to helping you grow and understand the experience “life”. Family is that group of people that sees something in you so valuable that their willing to stick around for the journey to see who you become! I have a lot of respect for people who hold on to family house hold values. What would life be without any support and motivation from people you live with? 

All in all remember to have sympathy for a person when they’re being vulnerable with you. Be patient, have an attentive ear and let’s guide one another the right direction. Towards the light. You never know the person spilling their heart out to you or venting, and seeking support from you might be doing so because when they think about family they think of you. 

May all your families find strength and wisdom with your presence brethren and may we all find a worthy brother to raise a become part of the Freemasonic family. 

With Love,
