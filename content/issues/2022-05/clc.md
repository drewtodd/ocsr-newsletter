Welcome back to the RiteCare Childhood Language Center of Orange County.  We are enjoying the sunshine and warmer weather!  Everyone is looking forward to the upcoming summer months.

As the spring semester comes to a close, we are so very happy to graduate many kids from our program! The ability to begin speech and language therapy services with us while the families wait to qualify for services elsewhere is invaluable. Early intervention is a cornerstone for speech and language growth.  Our families will often times start at the CLC and continue on with therapy when the children enter public school.  Families continue to thank us from week to week for the improvements they see in their children.  For many families this opportunity to attend CLC is life changing. 

We are happy to report that attendance has been a lot more consistent this spring and our schedules, for the most part, are full the whole time. We are thankful, in a way, to have a waiting list once again, as this is an indication that the clinic is returning to “normal” operations that we saw before COVID. We were also able to conduct many assessments this spring so we can enroll new children to replace the open spots in our schedule that were vacated by the recent graduates.

The wrapping up of another semester at Chapman University is always exciting for everyone involved! We were able to see some amazing growth not just in the children at the clinic but in the Chapman student clinicians as well. The student clinicians always learn so much during their time providing therapy services, and it is always fun to see them improve their skills. The experience at the CLC is unique, and the student clinicians consistently say they grow exponentially during their time here. We are all so grateful for this opportunity to help so many children and families.

Loyalty came to us because the parents couldn’t find services elsewhere. She has made progress, and now her parents have gotten insurance approval for private services. We will miss her!

Sincerely,
