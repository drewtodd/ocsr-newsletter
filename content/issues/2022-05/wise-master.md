Greetings Brethren,

As we learn in the Chapter Degrees, King Cyrus the Great was critically important in allowing the rebuilding of the second temple in Jerusalem. In the York Rite of Freemasonry, Capitular Masonry is dedicated to Zerubbabel for his overseeing the work but who was King Cyrus and how is he received outside of Masonic text? We know he died mysteriously in 522 BC whereby Darius claimed the throne and from Masonic legend, we learn that Cyrus was an incredibly wise leader. You can imagine how excited I became when I saw him referenced in a couple of books I was reading.

In the book Sapiens by Yuval Harari, we learn that Cyrus claimed not merely to rule the whole world, but to do so for the sake of all people. “We are conquering you for your own benefit,” said the Persians. Cyrus wanted the people he subjected to love him and to count themselves lucky to be Persian vassals. The most famous example of Cyrus’ innovative efforts to gain the approbation of a nation living under the thumb of his empire was his command that the Jewish exiles in Babylonia be allowed to return to their Judean homeland and rebuild their temple. He even offered them financial assistance. Cyrus did not see himself as a Persian king ruling over Jews – he was also the king of the Jews, and thus responsible for their welfare.

Darius too must have been entirely impressed by Cyrus’ great perspective or he needn’t had kept his vow to support Zerubbabel in his efforts.

In the book Fooled by Randomness by Nassim Taleb, I learned that Cyrus defeated Croesus, King of Lydia, who was considered the richest man of his time. In fact, Romance languages often use the expression “rich as Croesus” to describe a person of excessive wealth. Upon being burned alive, Croesus called Solon’s name and shouted, “Solon, you were right.” Legend has it that Solon, a Greek legislator known for his wisdom, wasn’t impressed by Croesus’ wealth. Croesus was so irked by his egregious lack of impression that he attempted to extract from him some validation. Croesus hubristically asked Solon if he had known a happier man than him (as if wealth equated to happiness). Solon replied, “The observation of the numerous misfortunes that attend all conditions forbids us to grow insolent upon our present enjoyments, or to admire a man’s happiness that may yet, in course of time, suffer change. For the uncertain future has yet to come, with all variety of future; and him only to whom the divinity has continued happiness until the end we may call happy.” In other words, it ain’t over till the fat lady sings but in time, Croesus would eventually heed this caution.

Cyrus asked about the nature of such unusual invocations, and he told him about Solon’s warning. This impressed Cyrus so much that he decided to spare Croesus’ life, as he reflected on the possibilities as far as his own fate was concerned. I am undoubtedly convinced that these experiences (and I’m sure many others) miraculously contributed not only to Zerubbabel’s success but also to the inspiration and lessons of our great Chapter Degrees.

In our calls to the Almoner, remember Brethren: He who giveth to charity, lendeth to the Lord.

Sincerely & Fraternally,
