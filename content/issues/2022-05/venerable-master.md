The government definition for family is  a group of two or more persons related by birth, marriage, or adoption who live together. Legally, all such related persons are considered as members of one family.
What kind of family are you from?  Are you from the classic nuclear family, which is a dad, mom and at least one kid?  (That was my experience growing up and the type of family my wife and I created for our children), or are you from a more non-traditional type of family?  Either way, I think we can all agree that no matter what the dynamic, the love and support that we get from our families, wether traditional or not, helps to make us who we are.  

We see a lot of single parent families and now it isn’t always just the mom doing all the parenting. More frequently, dad’s, aunts and uncles and even grandparents are all an integral part of a successful family life.  I’m sure everyone has a friend that is from a single parent family or is a single parent as portrayed by Tom Hanks, single dad, in “Sleepless in Seattle”.  A successful family dynamic can come from both traditional and non-traditional scenarios.

With the increasing number of divorce and remarriage in our society,  blended families have become an even more common type of family dynamic.  Again, we probably all know someone who is part of a blended family.  One of my favorite blended families is the Brady Family from the 1970’s TV show, the “Brady Bunch”. Most of us are probably also familiar with the more modern version of the blended family  -  the TV show “Modern Family”. While blending two families may be complicated, the family unit is strengthened by adding on extra  layers of support through aunts, uncles, grandparents, stepdads and stepmoms, and brothers and sisters. Double the family members and double the love and support! 

What is the best type of family?  For me, it has nothing to do with genetic connection and everything to do with love, compassion, and support.  While I love my blood family, I really love the other people who have chosen to be part of my family- not just the ones that I am legally bound to. There is always room for more love and more family.

Sincerely,
