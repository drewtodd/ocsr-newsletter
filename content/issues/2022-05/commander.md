Let's face it - families are a pain in the butt.

When you're a kid, your parents boss you around and tell you to do things - clean your room, brush your teeth.

When you get a little older, your parents mostly tell you what you CAN'T do - you can't just take the car and go for a road trip with the guys.

When you get married, you just change bosses... now it's your wife who tells you what you can and can't do - no sitting around in your skivvies eating potato chips and drinking beer.

When you have kids (and think it's finally YOUR turn to be boss), it turns out that they still control your life - you can't just run off to Vegas for the weekend on a whim.

Yup... families are a pain in the butt.

BUT...

When you're a kid, your parents are laying the groundwork for keeping you healthy and learning basic life skills.

When you get a little older, your parents are basically just trying to keep you alive (let's face it we were all boys who did stupid things) and instill in us the ideas of responsibility and mature thought.

When you get married, your wife is showing you that she loves you (most of the time) and wants to help you grow not only as a husband but as a couple.

When you have kids, you realize that all of the skills you've learned are now YOUR responsibility to pass along to the next generation.

And then there's Masonry...

Just like in any family, these men who are your Brothers may be friends, they may be co-workers, they may even be a giant pain in the butt.... but ultimately they are your chosen family and as such they want you to be the best YOU that you can be.

Fraternally,
