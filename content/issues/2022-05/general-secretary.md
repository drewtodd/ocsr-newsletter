Brethren: We had a very successful Stated Meeting in April. We were visited by Illustrious Harold Knowlton 33°, Personal Representative for the Valley of Phoenix. He was well received by our Brethren and enjoyed our meeting. From the Valley office, we want to thank the Brothers for your annual dues payments for 2022. This year, we have received steady dues payments. The Supreme portal at scottishrite.org accepts online payments. First mailings for 2023 dues payments will come out from Supreme in July. If you have any questions about your dues status, please contact the Secretary via email or phone. 

At our June Stated Meeting, we will be having our vote on raising 2024 annual dues to $120 from the current level of $105. As our dues have remained the same for a number of years and our expenses have increased, we need to make this change. Please show up at the June Stated Meeting to vote on this important matter. The increase will not show up until 2024 dues notices are mailed in 2023.

We will be holding a joint Reunion with the Valley of Long Beach on June 11th & 12th at the Scottish Rite Temple in Long Beach. Please try to visit one day to show support for our degree teams and our newest Brothers. An important aspect of the Scottish Rite is the exemplification of our degrees and a Reunion is the opportunity to see them. Our Stated Meeting for May is scheduled for Monday, May 9th at 6:30 pm at the DeMolay Center. If you want to have a voice in decisions that affect our Valley, please make a point of attending our Stated Meeting when possible. 

In closing, may you and your families enjoy good health and happiness for the remainder of 2022.

Fraternally,
