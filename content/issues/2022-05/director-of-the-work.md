It’s that time of the year again… reunion time! 

Given the extraordinary times we’ve all found ourselves in, we made the decision to join forces with a few of our fellow Valleys in Southern California for our next reunion. So on June 10th and 11th, our Valley will work with Long Beach (and hopefully a few others) to put on a great reunion for our new Scottish Rite Brothers! 

While our long term goal is to hold our own reunions at least once a year, the current plan will be this. Once a year, we’re going to work with our local Valleys (Long Beach, Los Angeles, Pasadena, San Bernardino, San Fernando) to put on larger reunions. We can expand the experience over a few days to put on upwards of 17 degrees! It’s going to take a lot of work, but I know that this is something we’ll all benefit from in the long run.

So here’s the call to action. One step at a time as we all get back to work in the Masonic sense… but I am asking for help from as many of you as I can. Every person matters here! I’m looking for Brothers who can do ritual, Brothers who can help with stage craft and wardrobe, and of course classroom communications. Over the next few years, this is going to be a huge undertaking that benefits us all, and I am so thrilled to be a part of it along with all of our Brethren from our local Valleys. Let’s get back to work… and not just back to work, but let’s all think outside the box and do more together! That’s how we grow, that is how the Scottish Rite will thrive!
