    <p>Please make plans to join us for dinner after Stated Meeting at 7:00pm. This month, Brother Griffen has cooked up the following delicious meal from Subway:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>Deli sandwich (turkey or ham)</li>
        <li>Chips</li>
        <li>Soda</li>
        <li>Cookie</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Cost of the meal is $14</p>

    <h2>New reservation system</h2>
    <p>Starting in March we will begin requesting reservations for dinner. We do this to avoid over-ordering and food waste.</p>
    <p>Reserving saves you money! Brothers who reserve in advance will get their meal at a price of $12, while brothers who dine with us without a reservation will pay $14.</p>
    <p><strong>Please contact Brother Larry Griffin</strong> (email <a href="mailto:rsvp@ocscottishrite.org">rsvp@ocscottishrite.org</a>) no later than a week prior to Stated Meeting to RSVP for dinner, and thanks in advance for your assitance and cooperation.</p>
