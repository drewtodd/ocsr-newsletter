      <description>Language Center Update Welcome back to the RiteCare Language Center of Orange County! We are very thankful for the new year and all the opportunity it brings to our children and families. We hope our friends at the ScottishRite Valley of Orange County will have a fantastic 2022!
Our families returned to the Childhood Language Center, Orange County in January after our winter break. As always we were prepared with updated COVID precautions which allow us to continue providing services for families who need in-person, face to face therapy.</description>

      <description>Greetings, Brethren!
For those of you who have not yet heard&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m the guy you want to know.
Because I&amp;rsquo;m your Brother? Nope - you have thousands of Brothers within the Fraternity. Because I&amp;rsquo;m a good cook? Nope - although I get no complaints from my wife. Because I&amp;rsquo;m a funny guy? Maybe, but there are plenty of funny guys in Masonry.
No, Brethren, the reason you want to know me is simple&amp;hellip; You want to know me because I&amp;rsquo;m looking for volunteers to help us do some fundraising.</description>

      <description>Brethren,
It&amp;rsquo;s April - the darkness of winter is behind us and spring brings with it the promise of warmth and light. Let&amp;rsquo;s use this as a reminder that no matter how cold and dark things may seem, there will always be warmth and light ahead of us.
We are in a period of renewal - we are returning to our Lodge and, in so doing, we are positioned to renew our activities to support our Brethren and support our charity - The RiteCare Childhood Language Center of Orange County.</description>

      <description>Director of Ritual Joshua and Muhammad–A Masonic Duad In the Master Mason chapter of Morals and Dogma, Albert Pike warns about the dangers of hypocrisy and ambition. Pike says that the highest object of human ambition is to subjugate the will of others because it is the exercise of the highest power. He points out that this subjugation of the will is at the bottom of both proselytizing and propagandism, and gives the example of the Catholic Church for the former and the French Republic for the latter.</description>

      <description>It’s that time of the year again… reunion time!
Given the extraordinary times we’ve all found ourselves in, we made the decision to join forces with a few of our fellow Valleys in Southern California for our next reunion. So on June 10th and 11th, our Valley will work with Long Beach (and hopefully a few others) to put on a great reunion for our new Scottish Rite Brothers!
While our long term goal is to hold our own reunions at least once a year, the current plan will be this.</description>

      <description>Master of Kadosh Greetings brethren,
For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know me, my name is Cristian De Dios, member of Anaheim Lodge 207.
I believe this months news letter is about brotherhood. Well, I just had aquick self-reflective moment where I envisioned myself growing up and playing soccer, basketball, baseball, and Varsity Football. Ive always loved being part of a team of kids or guys coming together for the purpose of helping each other win, get stronger, be more confident, using strategy to overcome obstacles, or just having a cool place to hang out and laugh at each other&amp;rsquo;s oddness.</description>

      <description>Greetings Brethren,
“Loyalty! Loyalty! Loyalty! Tell me what you’re loyal too…” - Kendrick Lamar ft. Rihanna
Some famous words they both sang on this cool song. Pretty much asking what are you loyal to? Is it money? Fame? Is it a hobby that brings you peace? Is it your woman? Your man? Maybe even God? Or your family? Everyone has something or someone that they’re loyal to above all else when no one is watching or when under pressure even in a moment of darkness.</description>

      <description>Greetings Brethren,
Here we are in a very pivotal moment in all of our lives. Some people are shedding the bad energy, laziness, and worry the pandemic has brought to our lives. Some of us are gearing up and getting back to the point we all left off at. Some of us are starting fresh changing our lives completely because the old habits just weren’t working out. However or whatever way you’re dealing with life now, just know that change can feel very uncomfortable and suspenseful.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to the RiteCare Language Center of Orange County! February continued to be a month of great success at our Language Center. As the weather starts to warm up a little the children are warming up their communication skills!
The student clinicians have been demonstrating great flexibility this month, while providing their clients with creative, focused lessons. We ramped up the evaluation process which is no paying off with a bunch of new clients.</description>

      <description>Senior Warden Brotherly Love Happy February, brothers; the month of love, as it were. With Valentines Day sitting squarely in the middle of the year’s shortest month, it’s worth knowing that February 14th was chosen as St. Valentine’s Day — or the Feast of St. Valentine — not for any rosy associations, but because that was the date that the Catholic priest Valentine was set to be executed by Emperor Claudius II.</description>

      <description>Senior Warden Have you made your New Years Resolutions? I don’t usually make a list for myself but I feel like I need to make some changes so the first change is to make a list. Obviously the idea is to make a list of goals that will help to make me a better person, husband, father, friend, brother during this year. Basically the last two years were bad and I don’t want to keep treading water.</description>

      <description>Venerable Master Hello my brothers and welcome to the new year and to the new line of officers for 2022. I am very honored to serve as the Venerable Master for this year and I am proud to be serving with all of the other officers.
This year we switched to a Zoom Officer Installation ceremony with a virtual Illustrious Frank Loui 33º SGIG as our Installation Officer. Illustrious Art Salazar 33º was virtually flawless as our Master of Ceremony.</description>

      <description>Loyalty is all about our relationships and how much they really mean to you. In the context of our Masonic relationship and our loyalty to each other this is defined by our Masonic principles, Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth.
Brother Love outlines our belief that we should care about each other and our community. This Love should extend beyond our lodge and teach us to behave with compassion to all our fellow humans.</description>

      <description>Venerable Master Greetings Brethren, I would like to take this moment to wish you a happy and prosperous New Year’s. May GOD Bless you and your family with many cherished memories, during this New Year’s that may last for generations to come.
It has been an Honor and privilege to serve our Orange County Valley Scottish Rite this year, as Venerable Master. This year did not start out like I imagined, with us still having to deal with the COVID restrictions.</description>

      <description>Wise Master Greetings Brethren,
Recently, my high school buddies and I started a podcast. We are all approaching 40 and thought: &amp;ldquo;Hmmm, x person knows football, y person knows litigation, z person knows technology and nth person, name your subject.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;ll keep the topics light and the characters many, people will follow, maybe a few laughs. I don&amp;rsquo;t know what we were thinking and don&amp;rsquo;t worry, I won&amp;rsquo;t pedal it on you in this venerable space.</description>

      <description>Greetings Brethren,
The 15th Degree teaches the great Law of ebb and flow using the destruction and rebuilding of the temple as example. We observe ebb and flow virtually everywhere in our lives; in nature, in politics, and in ourselves. In economics for example, the Austrian, Joseph Schumpeter in 1942 coined the term ‘Creative Destruction’ to describe the dismantling of status quo for innovation’s emergence as a driving force of productivity’s ability to rise.</description>

      <description>Greetings Brethren,
April is upon us and with that, we begin the second quarter of our Scottish Rite year. I like to take this time and reflect upon or renew the commitments made from our New Year’s Resolutions and if necessary, tweak or adjust as necessary. Personally, I have been chasing the same 15 pounds since college, promising to moderate my affection towards beer, drink less coke zero, and to read more regularly.</description>

      <description>Wise Master Elect Greetings Brethren,
I am looking forward to a new Scottish Rite year as your Wise Master elect in the Chapter Rose Croix and am even more excited to have our own Venerable elect, David Frias to my immediate right up there in the East, such as we were a few years ago with him as Commander (Council of Kadosh) and myself as Master of Kadosh (Consistory). How comforting indeed to partner with him again (as well as the other head of bodies)!</description>
