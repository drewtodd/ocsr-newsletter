            <h1>Master of Kadosh</h1>
            <p>Greetings Brethren,</p>
<p>Here we are in a very pivotal moment in all of our lives. Some people are shedding the bad energy, laziness, and worry the pandemic has brought to our lives. Some of us are gearing up and getting back to the point we all left off at. Some of us are starting fresh changing our lives completely because the old habits just weren’t working out. However or whatever way you’re dealing with life now, just know that change can feel very uncomfortable and suspenseful.</p>
<p>We were all born in a state of emergency of some sort. 0ur dads were probably speeding down roads to get to hospitals, our mothers probably dealing with severe pains! We as infants in the womb couldn’t feel this emergency going on we were just chilling in a warm belly wondering what all the fuss was about. At this point in our lives an energy is being born. We all feel it. We all fear it and we and don’t know what can be next, is it good or bad? Who knows? But will we allow governments, politicians, media, or trends renew our minds?</p>
<p>Will we let our trauma dictate how we move from here on out? Or will we OURSELVES take hold of our morals, great ideas, and conscience? Keeping our faith in god and our universe to help guide us through this pivotal moment is critical! Some of us need this change in order to become mentally stronger, some of us need this change to reflect on our actions and correct the mistakes we’ve been making. This transformation is happening to all of us just so you know.</p>
<p>Our planet is entering into a new era spiritually. Its bringing us anxiety, doubt, and maybe even pain. But let us not allow this boiling point to keep us worried. Because we all know that this next level or new era will be full of joy, wonderful surprises, wisdom and great opportunities to grow into our full potential. It’s our time to renew our promises to god and keep our faith strong.</p>
<p>It’s our time to give birth to a new version of our selves! Be hopeful, be strong, be patient with yourself, this next chapter has many blessings in store for us that will help us grow closer into our full potential as human beings!</p>
<p>May you all endeavor on a path of peace and prosperity,</p>

            <p>Brethren,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s April - the darkness of winter is behind us and spring brings with it the promise of warmth and light.  Let&rsquo;s use this as a reminder that no matter how cold and dark things may seem, there will always be warmth and light ahead of us.</p>
<p>We are in a period of renewal - we are returning to our Lodge and, in so doing, we are positioned to renew our activities to support our Brethren and support our charity - The RiteCare Childhood Language Center of Orange County.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to use this space to ask you all for money to support RiteCare (although by all means free to donate - oclanguagecenter.org).  What I am going to ask for is volunteers for the upcoming fashion show fundraiser.</p>
<p>No special skill or talent is needed to volunteer (I&rsquo;ll train, and the time commitment can be as little as a few hours).  Does your wife/girlfriend/kid love fashion?  They can volunteer as well!  What we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ushers - Ideally members of the KSA willing to work the night of the show in regalia (September 17th or 24th).</li>
<li>Social media team - who are willing and able to help build our social media presence.</li>
<li>Design team - folks who can create flyers, mailers, signage, social media ads, etc</li>
<li>Sponsorship &amp; Donation teams - people willing to do outreach and help increase the number of silent auction items and event sponsors (if you hate making calls to ask for these, don&rsquo;t worry - a big part of this is just email and/or request forms).</li>
<li>Bartenders (must be licensed) - this is a pretty fun opportunity - especially at the end of the evening, when all of the models hang out at the bar.</li>
<li>Security - we need some folks willing to just keep an eye on things during the event.</li>
<li>General volunteers - overall, it takes more than 100 volunteers to produce a show, so if you want to help, we&rsquo;ll find a role that fits your interests and availability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to sign up as a volunteer?  Scan the QR code below or go to <a href="https://bit.ly/OCSRvolunteer">https://bit.ly/OCSRvolunteer</a></p>

<p>Or&hellip; just let me know at 650-863-4767 or <a href="mailto:todd@quantimark.com">todd@quantimark.com</a></p>
<p>With your help, we can make this a great event and raise thousands of dollars to support the clinic!</p>

            <p>Brethren:</p>
<p>Spring has arrived, and with that comes our Spring Reunion in early June. If you haven&rsquo;t attended a Reunion recently, please make a point of seeing a degree or two. We will confirm the exact dates and all other info in the May newsletter.</p>
<p>After much consideration, input from Supreme and the leadership in our Valley, a recommendation to increase our annual dues will come to vote during our June stated meeting. As many of you know, our Valley have not had an increase in dues in 9 years. This decision is being driven by the increase in operations cost, as many expenses have gone up considerably. 
Our insurance cost has increased by 50% in the last 2 years, along with other purchases required to run our Valley. The proposal is to increase our dues from $105 to $120 per year.</p>
<p>Brothers, we don&rsquo;t take lightly the idea of increasing our dues as we know that many of us have membership with other Masonic organizations. 
Therefore, we are publishing this proposal in our newsletter, so the information reaches all members of the Valley.</p>
<p>The increase proposed would not affect the dues for 2023. Dues notices for 2023 will start arriving at home this July with the existing $105 dues. Dues notices for 2024 that are mailed out in July 2023 would reflect the new dues of $120.</p>
<p>May you and your families have a great Spring.</p>
<p>Fraternally,</p>

            <h1>Wise Master</h1>
            <p>Greetings Brethren,</p>
<p>April is upon us and with that, we begin the second quarter of our Scottish Rite year. I like to take this time and reflect upon or renew the commitments made from our New Year’s Resolutions and if necessary, tweak or adjust as necessary. Personally, I have been chasing the same 15 pounds since college, promising to moderate my affection towards beer, drink less coke zero, and to read more regularly. Freemasonry provides us an excellent system of ‘check-ins’ and introspections to milestone our progress, trade off where inappropriate or occasionally, abandon all together. A beautiful framework of morality that begins within our ability to hold ourselves accountable. I would say that I am sufficiently making progress. “There is no try,” as Grand Master Yoda said it.</p>
<p>The sixteenth degree or Prince of Jerusalem takes place in the Court of Zerubbabel, Governor of Judah (representing Jerusalem), within the council-chamber of the king of Persia (representing Babylon), and the country or passage that separates the two empires. The degree builds upon the lessons taught in the preceding degree with a particular emphasis on the virtues of faithfulness and wisdom as exemplified on the belief that God aids those who pursue a good work. Holiness to the Lord.</p>
<p>The Second Temple was completed by Zerubbabel in the sixth year of the reign of Darius (following more than four centuries after the original completion of King Solomon’s Temple) and it’s rebuilding was not exactly smooth (which we will discuss in more detail in the next couple of months). But essentially, our rank and dignity as Masons is attained through courteous, kind, and just Masonic labor. In the closing of the degree, we are reminded that during our rest from our labors, our God has extended mercy unto us, given us new life, that He may make us to prosper.</p>
<p>I’d like to thank the brethren for their support during my temporary absence as well as all the shout outs, emails, and texts of encouragement. Our third child, Norah was born to us on Saturday, March 5th to a happy and welcoming home. I had the honor of delivering her myself, with my other two kids present here in our home. My wife, Nastasia is recovering nicely. I’ll probably miss our April meeting as we march ourselves into some of the tough and tiring weeks ahead. Mind you, my older kiddos have come to expect a certain quality of life that our third cannot interrupt. :p</p>
<p>In our calls to the Almoner, remember Brethren: He who giveth to charity, lendeth to the Lord.</p>
<p>Sincerely &amp; Fraternally,</p>

            <h1>Director of the Work</h1>
            <p>It’s that time of the year again… reunion time!</p>
<p>Given the extraordinary times we’ve all found ourselves in, we made the decision to join forces with a few of our fellow Valleys in Southern California for our next reunion. So on June 10th and 11th, our Valley will work with Long Beach (and hopefully a few others) to put on a great reunion for our new Scottish Rite Brothers!</p>
<p>While our long term goal is to hold our own reunions at least once a year, the current plan will be this. Once a year, we’re going to work with our local Valleys (Long Beach, Los Angeles, Pasadena, San Bernardino, San Fernando) to put on larger reunions. We can expand the experience over a few days to put on upwards of 17 degrees! It’s going to take a lot of work, but I know that this is something we’ll all benefit from in the long run.</p>
<p>So here’s the call to action. One step at a time as we all get back to work in the Masonic sense… but I am asking for help from as many of you as I can. Every person matters here! I’m looking for Brothers who can do ritual, Brothers who can help with stage craft and wardrobe, and of course classroom communications. Over the next few years, this is going to be a huge undertaking that benefits us all, and I am so thrilled to be a part of it along with all of our Brethren from our local Valleys. Let’s get back to work… and not just back to work, but let’s all think outside the box and do more together! That’s how we grow, that is how the Scottish Rite will thrive!</p>
