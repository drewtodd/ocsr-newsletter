<h1>Commander of Kadosh</h1>

<p>Brethren,</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s April - the darkness of winter is behind us and spring brings with it the promise of warmth and light.  Let&rsquo;s use this as a reminder that no matter how cold and dark things may seem, there will always be warmth and light ahead of us.</p>
<p>We are in a period of renewal - we are returning to our Lodge and, in so doing, we are positioned to renew our activities to support our Brethren and support our charity - The RiteCare Childhood Language Center of Orange County.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not going to use this space to ask you all for money to support RiteCare (although by all means free to donate - oclanguagecenter.org).  What I am going to ask for is volunteers for the upcoming fashion show fundraiser.</p>
<p>No special skill or talent is needed to volunteer (I&rsquo;ll train, and the time commitment can be as little as a few hours).  Does your wife/girlfriend/kid love fashion?  They can volunteer as well!  What we need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ushers - Ideally members of the KSA willing to work the night of the show in regalia (September 17th or 24th).</li>
<li>Social media team - who are willing and able to help build our social media presence.</li>
<li>Design team - folks who can create flyers, mailers, signage, social media ads, etc</li>
<li>Sponsorship &amp; Donation teams - people willing to do outreach and help increase the number of silent auction items and event sponsors (if you hate making calls to ask for these, don&rsquo;t worry - a big part of this is just email and/or request forms).</li>
<li>Bartenders (must be licensed) - this is a pretty fun opportunity - especially at the end of the evening, when all of the models hang out at the bar.</li>
<li>Security - we need some folks willing to just keep an eye on things during the event.</li>
<li>General volunteers - overall, it takes more than 100 volunteers to produce a show, so if you want to help, we&rsquo;ll find a role that fits your interests and availability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to sign up as a volunteer?  Scan the QR code below or go to <a href="https://bit.ly/OCSRvolunteer">https://bit.ly/OCSRvolunteer</a></p>

<p>Or&hellip; just let me know at 650-863-4767 or <a href="mailto:todd@quantimark.com">todd@quantimark.com</a></p>
<p>With your help, we can make this a great event and raise thousands of dollars to support the clinic!</p>
