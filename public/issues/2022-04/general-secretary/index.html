<h1>General Secretary</h1>

<p>Brethren:</p>
<p>Spring has arrived, and with that comes our Spring Reunion in early June. If you haven&rsquo;t attended a Reunion recently, please make a point of seeing a degree or two. We will confirm the exact dates and all other info in the May newsletter.</p>
<p>After much consideration, input from Supreme and the leadership in our Valley, a recommendation to increase our annual dues will come to vote during our June stated meeting. As many of you know, our Valley have not had an increase in dues in 9 years. This decision is being driven by the increase in operations cost, as many expenses have gone up considerably. 
Our insurance cost has increased by 50% in the last 2 years, along with other purchases required to run our Valley. The proposal is to increase our dues from $105 to $120 per year.</p>
<p>Brothers, we don&rsquo;t take lightly the idea of increasing our dues as we know that many of us have membership with other Masonic organizations. 
Therefore, we are publishing this proposal in our newsletter, so the information reaches all members of the Valley.</p>
<p>The increase proposed would not affect the dues for 2023. Dues notices for 2023 will start arriving at home this July with the existing $105 dues. Dues notices for 2024 that are mailed out in July 2023 would reflect the new dues of $120.</p>
<p>May you and your families have a great Spring.</p>
<p>Fraternally,</p>
