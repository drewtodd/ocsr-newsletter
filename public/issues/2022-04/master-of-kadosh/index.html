<h1>Master of Kadosh</h1>

<p>Greetings Brethren,</p>
<p>Here we are in a very pivotal moment in all of our lives. Some people are shedding the bad energy, laziness, and worry the pandemic has brought to our lives. Some of us are gearing up and getting back to the point we all left off at. Some of us are starting fresh changing our lives completely because the old habits just weren’t working out. However or whatever way you’re dealing with life now, just know that change can feel very uncomfortable and suspenseful.</p>
<p>We were all born in a state of emergency of some sort. 0ur dads were probably speeding down roads to get to hospitals, our mothers probably dealing with severe pains! We as infants in the womb couldn’t feel this emergency going on we were just chilling in a warm belly wondering what all the fuss was about. At this point in our lives an energy is being born. We all feel it. We all fear it and we and don’t know what can be next, is it good or bad? Who knows? But will we allow governments, politicians, media, or trends renew our minds?</p>
<p>Will we let our trauma dictate how we move from here on out? Or will we OURSELVES take hold of our morals, great ideas, and conscience? Keeping our faith in god and our universe to help guide us through this pivotal moment is critical! Some of us need this change in order to become mentally stronger, some of us need this change to reflect on our actions and correct the mistakes we’ve been making. This transformation is happening to all of us just so you know.</p>
<p>Our planet is entering into a new era spiritually. Its bringing us anxiety, doubt, and maybe even pain. But let us not allow this boiling point to keep us worried. Because we all know that this next level or new era will be full of joy, wonderful surprises, wisdom and great opportunities to grow into our full potential. It’s our time to renew our promises to god and keep our faith strong.</p>
<p>It’s our time to give birth to a new version of our selves! Be hopeful, be strong, be patient with yourself, this next chapter has many blessings in store for us that will help us grow closer into our full potential as human beings!</p>
<p>May you all endeavor on a path of peace and prosperity,</p>
