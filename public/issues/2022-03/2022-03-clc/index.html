<h1>Ritecare Childhood Language Center of Orange County</h1>

<p>Welcome back to the RiteCare Language Center of Orange County! February continued to be a month of great success at our Language Center.  As the weather starts to warm up a little the children are warming up their communication skills!</p>
<p>The student clinicians have been demonstrating great flexibility this month, while providing their clients with creative, focused lessons. We ramped up the evaluation process which is no paying off with a bunch of new clients. The CLC joyfully welcomed a new clients almost every day in February.</p>
<p>When the COVID numbers were rapidly rising the CLC was prepared to rise to the challenge.  When a child has concerns about COVID exposure the student clinicians are able to quickly and seamlessly transition the family to a Telehealth session, even at the last minute if necessary. Because of this flexibility we have very few missed sessions this month. Ezra has had multiple health issues since December, and his mother was thrilled to be able to join via Telehealth for a few sessions until he could return in person. He even got to show off his new communication skills to his big sister!</p>
<p>February was also a month of fun! Everyone enjoys Valentine’s Day, and children practiced their language skills while making Valentines for their parents.</p>
<p>Celeste came to the clinic in May of last year with multiple speech sound errors. Now, after much practice, she’s corrected all but her last sound, which is also clearing up quickly.</p>
<p>Lachlan is also working hard on his speech sounds. His mom is able to watch all of his therapy sessions on the monitors that are installed in each therapy room.</p>
<p>Kingston and his sister were evaluated just this semester and now they are both off to a great start!</p>
<p>We continue to be grateful for all the support we receive that allows us to not only have the clinic up and running but also allows us to give generously into the lives of each child who walks through our doors.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
