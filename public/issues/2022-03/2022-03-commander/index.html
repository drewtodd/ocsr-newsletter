<h1>Commander of Kadosh</h1>

<p>Greetings, Brethren!</p>
<p>For those of you who have not yet heard&hellip; I&rsquo;m the guy you want to know.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m your Brother?  Nope - you have thousands of Brothers within the Fraternity.  Because I&rsquo;m a good cook? Nope - although I get no complaints from my wife.  Because I&rsquo;m a funny guy?  Maybe, but there are plenty of funny guys in Masonry.</p>
<p>No, Brethren, the reason you want to know me is simple&hellip; You want to know me because I&rsquo;m looking for volunteers to help us do some fundraising.</p>
<p>Wait. What?  Why on earth would you want to know the guy who wants to put you to work?</p>
<p>For a few simple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s to support the Childhood Language Center</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s part of our oath, to loyally support our charities</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a fashion show fundraiser and it means you&rsquo;ll get to hang out with models.</li>
</ol>

         alt="Scottish Rite officers pose with a model at a San Francisco fashion show"/>
</figure>
<p>Yes, Brethren, I&rsquo;ve been producing fashion shows as fundraisers for many, many years and I&rsquo;m looking for a few good Brothers who want to hang out with smoking hot models help support the kids with a fundraising event.</p>
<p>No matter your skills, we have a volunteer role for you.  We need everything from ticket takers to graphic designers, social media gurus to caterers - if you want to help, we&rsquo;ll put you to work.</p>
<p>By the way, if you haven&rsquo;t joined the KSA yet, now would be an EXCELLENT time to do so - I can tell you from my past experience producing these shows in San Francisco that all of the ladies want to get their picture taken on the red carpet&hellip; especially with the guys in the kilts.</p>
<p>Want to help?  Drop me a line at <a href="mailto:todd@quantimark.com">todd@quantimark.com</a> and let me know where your talents lie - I&rsquo;ll put you in touch with the appropriate team chair.</p>
