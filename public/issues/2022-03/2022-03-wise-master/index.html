<h1>Wise Master</h1>

<p>Greetings Brethren,</p>
<p>The 15th Degree teaches the great Law of ebb and flow using the destruction and rebuilding of the temple as example. We observe ebb and flow virtually everywhere in our lives; in nature, in politics, and in ourselves. In economics for example, the Austrian, Joseph Schumpeter in 1942 coined the term ‘Creative Destruction’ to describe the dismantling of status quo for innovation’s emergence as a driving force of productivity’s ability to rise. I posit further where we can calculate equilibrium in the short term, or a very specific and static point in our measurement, it is dynamically balanced through this beautiful Law of change. This process of ‘cyclic progression’ leads towards greater perfection with Truth arrived as the ultimate result which we learn can only be confronted from the reality of polarity. Winners and losers, up and down, hot and cold, order and chaos. This helps explains why opposites exist in our world or as I submit to the Brethren, the exercise of strong opinions, weakly held to enable similar mental practices.</p>

<p>The Degree itself describes an intimate conversation where Zerubbabel asks King Cyrus to fulfil his promise of freeing the Judean people who have languished in captivity that they may rebuild the temple and restore the worship of the true God. Zerubbabel’s fidelity, coupled with divine wisdom in the form a timely dream by Cyrus, restored the great powers of Zerubbabel. Honor and loyalty bestowed upon Zerubbabel enabled his ‘Liberty of Passage’ representing a bridge by assuaging Cyrus’ great debate. Truth being the victor.</p>
<p>As you read these words, we are moments away from the arrival of our third child and I’d like to remind the Brethren of my expected absence from our March and probably April stated meetings. I hereby reiterate the call to my Senior and Junior Wardens to assist me in the duties as Wise Master. Brothers Larry Griffin and David Lockwood will ensure the Chapter is in good hands and give everybody an opportunity for renewal and remembrance. As a personal request, I would appreciate everybody’s positive thoughts for my wife having a successful delivery. Thank you in advance!</p>
<p>In our calls to the Almoner, remember Brethren: He who giveth to charity, lendeth to the Lord.</p>
<p>Sincerely &amp; Fraternally,</p>
