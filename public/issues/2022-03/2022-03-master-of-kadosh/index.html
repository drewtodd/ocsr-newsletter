<p>Greetings Brethren,</p>
<p>“Loyalty! Loyalty! Loyalty! Tell me what you’re loyal too…” - Kendrick Lamar ft. Rihanna</p>
<p>Some famous words they both sang on this cool song. Pretty much asking what are you loyal to? Is it money? Fame? Is it a hobby that brings you peace? Is it your woman? Your man? Maybe even God? Or your family? Everyone has something or someone that they’re loyal to above all else when no one is watching or when under pressure even in a moment of darkness. As we progress in our degrees in Freemasonry for Blue Lodge or Scottish Rite we take obligations in order to really understand the importance of our secrets or duties owed to God’s lodge and ourselves. Let’s not disregard these obligations or commandments because at the end of the day we live in a karmic universe which takes for granted all that we say or do against others. Let’s be loyal to these obligations even though we might still be looking for a group or person who might be deserving of our energy.</p>

<p>In the 28th degree “Knight Commander of The Temple”, in our book A Bridge to Light (p260), it talks about how “King Arthur had assembled the most virtuous and gallant men for his army. “He created them Knights and devoted them to causes of right, the poor, and needy and honor.” But how his “idyllic world came crashing down when the frailty of the flesh prevailed— a knight fell in love with Arthur’s queen and Arthur’s step brother greedily and jealously pursued the throne.” Basically once the loyalty was gone between his knights and family there was no more respect, everyone was out for their own benefit. It also states that “knighthood came to an end as a result of human weaknesses— greed, political and religious corruption and, in general the loss of selfless attitude by knights…”</p>
<p>Let’s not forget our “why” brethren, let’s not forget our obligations, or those reasons we are loyal to our human family. Although life wants us split up in as many ways as possible so we forget what it means to be a “knight”, a brother, or fathers to our families. We must continue having faith in our God and knights of the spiritual light. That he and we will guide the blind towards a better future walking the righteous paths we have chosen to take to save us of our 
own detriment.</p>
<p>Be well brethren. Stay loyal.</p>
