            <h1>Wise Master</h1>
            <p>Greetings Brethren,</p>
<p>The 15th Degree teaches the great Law of ebb and flow using the destruction and rebuilding of the temple as example. We observe ebb and flow virtually everywhere in our lives; in nature, in politics, and in ourselves. In economics for example, the Austrian, Joseph Schumpeter in 1942 coined the term ‘Creative Destruction’ to describe the dismantling of status quo for innovation’s emergence as a driving force of productivity’s ability to rise. I posit further where we can calculate equilibrium in the short term, or a very specific and static point in our measurement, it is dynamically balanced through this beautiful Law of change. This process of ‘cyclic progression’ leads towards greater perfection with Truth arrived as the ultimate result which we learn can only be confronted from the reality of polarity. Winners and losers, up and down, hot and cold, order and chaos. This helps explains why opposites exist in our world or as I submit to the Brethren, the exercise of strong opinions, weakly held to enable similar mental practices.</p>
<figure class="clear border shadow"><img src="img/king-cyrus.png"
         alt="An illustration of King Cyrus"/><figcaption>
            <p>King Cyrus</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The Degree itself describes an intimate conversation where Zerubbabel asks King Cyrus to fulfil his promise of freeing the Judean people who have languished in captivity that they may rebuild the temple and restore the worship of the true God. Zerubbabel’s fidelity, coupled with divine wisdom in the form a timely dream by Cyrus, restored the great powers of Zerubbabel. Honor and loyalty bestowed upon Zerubbabel enabled his ‘Liberty of Passage’ representing a bridge by assuaging Cyrus’ great debate. Truth being the victor.</p>
<p>As you read these words, we are moments away from the arrival of our third child and I’d like to remind the Brethren of my expected absence from our March and probably April stated meetings. I hereby reiterate the call to my Senior and Junior Wardens to assist me in the duties as Wise Master. Brothers Larry Griffin and David Lockwood will ensure the Chapter is in good hands and give everybody an opportunity for renewal and remembrance. As a personal request, I would appreciate everybody’s positive thoughts for my wife having a successful delivery. Thank you in advance!</p>
<p>In our calls to the Almoner, remember Brethren: He who giveth to charity, lendeth to the Lord.</p>
<p>Sincerely &amp; Fraternally,</p>

            <h1>Master of Kadosh</h1>
            <p>Greetings Brethren,</p>
<p>“Loyalty! Loyalty! Loyalty! Tell me what you’re loyal too…” - Kendrick Lamar ft. Rihanna</p>
<p>Some famous words they both sang on this cool song. Pretty much asking what are you loyal to? Is it money? Fame? Is it a hobby that brings you peace? Is it your woman? Your man? Maybe even God? Or your family? Everyone has something or someone that they’re loyal to above all else when no one is watching or when under pressure even in a moment of darkness. As we progress in our degrees in Freemasonry for Blue Lodge or Scottish Rite we take obligations in order to really understand the importance of our secrets or duties owed to God’s lodge and ourselves. Let’s not disregard these obligations or commandments because at the end of the day we live in a karmic universe which takes for granted all that we say or do against others. Let’s be loyal to these obligations even though we might still be looking for a group or person who might be deserving of our energy.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Loyalty! Loyalty! Loyalty! Tell me what you’re loyal too…” - Kendrick Lamar ft. Rihanna</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the 28th degree “Knight Commander of The Temple”, in our book A Bridge to Light (p260), it talks about how “King Arthur had assembled the most virtuous and gallant men for his army. “He created them Knights and devoted them to causes of right, the poor, and needy and honor.” But how his “idyllic world came crashing down when the frailty of the flesh prevailed— a knight fell in love with Arthur’s queen and Arthur’s step brother greedily and jealously pursued the throne.” Basically once the loyalty was gone between his knights and family there was no more respect, everyone was out for their own benefit. It also states that “knighthood came to an end as a result of human weaknesses— greed, political and religious corruption and, in general the loss of selfless attitude by knights…”</p>
<p>Let’s not forget our “why” brethren, let’s not forget our obligations, or those reasons we are loyal to our human family. Although life wants us split up in as many ways as possible so we forget what it means to be a “knight”, a brother, or fathers to our families. We must continue having faith in our God and knights of the spiritual light. That he and we will guide the blind towards a better future walking the righteous paths we have chosen to take to save us of our 
own detriment.</p>
<p>Be well brethren. Stay loyal.</p>

            <p>Greetings, Brethren!</p>
<p>For those of you who have not yet heard&hellip; I&rsquo;m the guy you want to know.</p>
<p>Because I&rsquo;m your Brother?  Nope - you have thousands of Brothers within the Fraternity.  Because I&rsquo;m a good cook? Nope - although I get no complaints from my wife.  Because I&rsquo;m a funny guy?  Maybe, but there are plenty of funny guys in Masonry.</p>
<p>No, Brethren, the reason you want to know me is simple&hellip; You want to know me because I&rsquo;m looking for volunteers to help us do some fundraising.</p>
<p>Wait. What?  Why on earth would you want to know the guy who wants to put you to work?</p>
<p>For a few simple reasons:</p>
<ol>
<li>It&rsquo;s to support the Childhood Language Center</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s part of our oath, to loyally support our charities</li>
<li>It&rsquo;s a fashion show fundraiser and it means you&rsquo;ll get to hang out with models.</li>
</ol>
<figure class="right large pad-top border shadow"><img src="img/fashion-show.png"
         alt="Scottish Rite officers pose with a model at a San Francisco fashion show"/>
</figure>
<p>Yes, Brethren, I&rsquo;ve been producing fashion shows as fundraisers for many, many years and I&rsquo;m looking for a few good Brothers who want to hang out with smoking hot models help support the kids with a fundraising event.</p>
<p>No matter your skills, we have a volunteer role for you.  We need everything from ticket takers to graphic designers, social media gurus to caterers - if you want to help, we&rsquo;ll put you to work.</p>
<p>By the way, if you haven&rsquo;t joined the KSA yet, now would be an EXCELLENT time to do so - I can tell you from my past experience producing these shows in San Francisco that all of the ladies want to get their picture taken on the red carpet&hellip; especially with the guys in the kilts.</p>
<p>Want to help?  Drop me a line at <a href="mailto:todd@quantimark.com">todd@quantimark.com</a> and let me know where your talents lie - I&rsquo;ll put you in touch with the appropriate team chair.</p>

            <h1>General Secretary</h1>
            <p>Brethren: We are planning on having an in-person Stated Meeting at the DeMolay Center on Monday, March 7th. You should receive an email with full information a few days prior to the meeting. Please plan on attending our Stated Meeting to participate in the fellowship and camaraderie of our Valley.  Dues payments continue to come in to our office from  both mail and the Supreme online payment portal. We thank you Brothers for supporting the operation of our Valley with your dues payments. If you have any questions about your dues status, please call or email the Secretary.</p>
<p>We are planning on having our Spring Reunion in April. We are looking for good candidates. If you know a Master Mason who would enjoy the benefits of OCSR membership, please speak to him.  Many Masons are searching for more education and light on our Craft. The 29 degrees of the Scottish Rite and our Master Craftsmen program fill that need perfectly. As our lives are returning to a relative normal, think about what kind of events and functions you would like to see at our Valley. Has your Blue Lodge had great success with a ceremony or occasion? Did it let the public know about the positive activities and traditions of Freemasonry? If so, let us know about it. Spring is the time of growth and let’s grow our Valley now.</p>
<p>Fraternally,</p>

            <h1>Venerable Master</h1>
            <p>Loyalty is all about our relationships and how much they really mean to you.  In the context of our Masonic relationship and our loyalty to each other this is defined by our Masonic principles, Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth.</p>
<p>Brother Love outlines our belief that we should care about each other and our community.  This Love should extend beyond our lodge and teach us to behave with compassion to all our fellow humans.  Brotherly Love is what makes attending the lodge so special and helps to foster our loyalty to the Lodge.</p>
<p>Relief means that we should practice charity and to care about our fellow man.  I learned about providing relief before I became a Mason, so this is certainly my favorite principle to follow.  I truly believe in the benefits that our Language Centers provide to so many people in our community.</p>
<p>Truth requires us to always hold ourselves to a high moral standard.  Truth and Loyalty certainly go hand in hand with each other.</p>
<figure class="right large pad-top border shadow"><img src="img/bracelet.png"
         alt="A silver Masonic bracelet"/>
</figure>
<p>How do you show your loyalty to your lodge?  I don’t wear any jewelry currently, not even a wedding ring because my skin reacts poorly to the metal.  Many Brothers will get a ring after they become a Master Mason but so far I haven’t made the leap.  Illustrious Frankie Rosario has a beautiful masonic ring that he wears proudly to show his loyalty to our fraternity.  Maybe a bracelet is a better choice for me.  I read recently that a bracelet is a great way to show our loyalty!</p>
<p>With love and respect,</p>

            <h1>Ritecare Childhood Language Center of Orange County</h1>
            <p>Welcome back to the RiteCare Language Center of Orange County! February continued to be a month of great success at our Language Center.  As the weather starts to warm up a little the children are warming up their communication skills!</p>
<p>The student clinicians have been demonstrating great flexibility this month, while providing their clients with creative, focused lessons. We ramped up the evaluation process which is no paying off with a bunch of new clients. The CLC joyfully welcomed a new clients almost every day in February.</p>
<p>When the COVID numbers were rapidly rising the CLC was prepared to rise to the challenge.  When a child has concerns about COVID exposure the student clinicians are able to quickly and seamlessly transition the family to a Telehealth session, even at the last minute if necessary. Because of this flexibility we have very few missed sessions this month. Ezra has had multiple health issues since December, and his mother was thrilled to be able to join via Telehealth for a few sessions until he could return in person. He even got to show off his new communication skills to his big sister!</p>
<p>February was also a month of fun! Everyone enjoys Valentine’s Day, and children practiced their language skills while making Valentines for their parents.</p>
<p>Celeste came to the clinic in May of last year with multiple speech sound errors. Now, after much practice, she’s corrected all but her last sound, which is also clearing up quickly.</p>
<p>Lachlan is also working hard on his speech sounds. His mom is able to watch all of his therapy sessions on the monitors that are installed in each therapy room.</p>
<p>Kingston and his sister were evaluated just this semester and now they are both off to a great start!</p>
<p>We continue to be grateful for all the support we receive that allows us to not only have the clinic up and running but also allows us to give generously into the lives of each child who walks through our doors.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>You don’t have to be a head of body or a member of the line to contribute to this newsletter! If you have something to say from a masonic perspective — perhaps insights into your masonic ruminations, scholarly endeavors you’d like to share, or general news for the brethren — this newsletter is your conduit for those ideas. I encourage any and all brothers who’d like to contribute something to this newsletter to send their ideas to:</p>
<p><strong><a href="mailto:editor@ocscottishrite.org">editor@ocscottishrite.org</a></strong></p>
<p>I’ll work with you on getting your article together for the next issue.</p>
<p>Fraternally,</p>
