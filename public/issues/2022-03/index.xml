      <description>Greetings, Brethren!
For those of you who have not yet heard&amp;hellip; I&amp;rsquo;m the guy you want to know.
Because I&amp;rsquo;m your Brother? Nope - you have thousands of Brothers within the Fraternity. Because I&amp;rsquo;m a good cook? Nope - although I get no complaints from my wife. Because I&amp;rsquo;m a funny guy? Maybe, but there are plenty of funny guys in Masonry.
No, Brethren, the reason you want to know me is simple&amp;hellip; You want to know me because I&amp;rsquo;m looking for volunteers to help us do some fundraising.</description>

      <description>I’d like to express my thanks again to the heads of body for contributing their excellent and thoughtful articles this month and for doing so in a timely fashion.
Calling All Writers!  You don’t have to be a head of body or a member of the line to contribute to this newsletter! If you have something to say from a masonic perspective — perhaps insights into your masonic ruminations, scholarly endeavors you’d like to share, or general news for the brethren — this newsletter is your conduit for those ideas.</description>

      <description>Greetings Brethren,
“Loyalty! Loyalty! Loyalty! Tell me what you’re loyal too…” - Kendrick Lamar ft. Rihanna
Some famous words they both sang on this cool song. Pretty much asking what are you loyal to? Is it money? Fame? Is it a hobby that brings you peace? Is it your woman? Your man? Maybe even God? Or your family? Everyone has something or someone that they’re loyal to above all else when no one is watching or when under pressure even in a moment of darkness.</description>

      <description>Welcome back to the RiteCare Language Center of Orange County! February continued to be a month of great success at our Language Center. As the weather starts to warm up a little the children are warming up their communication skills!
The student clinicians have been demonstrating great flexibility this month, while providing their clients with creative, focused lessons. We ramped up the evaluation process which is no paying off with a bunch of new clients.</description>

      <description>Loyalty is all about our relationships and how much they really mean to you. In the context of our Masonic relationship and our loyalty to each other this is defined by our Masonic principles, Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth.
Brother Love outlines our belief that we should care about each other and our community. This Love should extend beyond our lodge and teach us to behave with compassion to all our fellow humans.</description>

      <description>Greetings Brethren,
The 15th Degree teaches the great Law of ebb and flow using the destruction and rebuilding of the temple as example. We observe ebb and flow virtually everywhere in our lives; in nature, in politics, and in ourselves. In economics for example, the Austrian, Joseph Schumpeter in 1942 coined the term ‘Creative Destruction’ to describe the dismantling of status quo for innovation’s emergence as a driving force of productivity’s ability to rise.</description>
