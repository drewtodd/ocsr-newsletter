<h1>General Secretary</h1>

<p>Brethren: We are planning on having an in-person Stated Meeting at the DeMolay Center on Monday, March 7th. You should receive an email with full information a few days prior to the meeting. Please plan on attending our Stated Meeting to participate in the fellowship and camaraderie of our Valley.  Dues payments continue to come in to our office from  both mail and the Supreme online payment portal. We thank you Brothers for supporting the operation of our Valley with your dues payments. If you have any questions about your dues status, please call or email the Secretary.</p>
<p>We are planning on having our Spring Reunion in April. We are looking for good candidates. If you know a Master Mason who would enjoy the benefits of OCSR membership, please speak to him.  Many Masons are searching for more education and light on our Craft. The 29 degrees of the Scottish Rite and our Master Craftsmen program fill that need perfectly. As our lives are returning to a relative normal, think about what kind of events and functions you would like to see at our Valley. Has your Blue Lodge had great success with a ceremony or occasion? Did it let the public know about the positive activities and traditions of Freemasonry? If so, let us know about it. Spring is the time of growth and letâ€™s grow our Valley now.</p>
<p>Fraternally,</p>
