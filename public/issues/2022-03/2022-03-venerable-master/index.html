<h1>Venerable Master</h1>

<p>Loyalty is all about our relationships and how much they really mean to you.  In the context of our Masonic relationship and our loyalty to each other this is defined by our Masonic principles, Brotherly Love, Relief and Truth.</p>
<p>Brother Love outlines our belief that we should care about each other and our community.  This Love should extend beyond our lodge and teach us to behave with compassion to all our fellow humans.  Brotherly Love is what makes attending the lodge so special and helps to foster our loyalty to the Lodge.</p>
<p>Relief means that we should practice charity and to care about our fellow man.  I learned about providing relief before I became a Mason, so this is certainly my favorite principle to follow.  I truly believe in the benefits that our Language Centers provide to so many people in our community.</p>
<p>Truth requires us to always hold ourselves to a high moral standard.  Truth and Loyalty certainly go hand in hand with each other.</p>

<p>How do you show your loyalty to your lodge?  I don’t wear any jewelry currently, not even a wedding ring because my skin reacts poorly to the metal.  Many Brothers will get a ring after they become a Master Mason but so far I haven’t made the leap.  Illustrious Frankie Rosario has a beautiful masonic ring that he wears proudly to show his loyalty to our fraternity.  Maybe a bracelet is a better choice for me.  I read recently that a bracelet is a great way to show our loyalty!</p>
<p>With love and respect,</p>
