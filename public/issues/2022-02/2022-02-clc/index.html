<h1 id="language-center-update">Language Center Update</h1>
<p>Welcome back to the RiteCare Language Center of Orange County!  We are very thankful for the new year and all the opportunity it brings to our children and families.  We hope our friends at the ScottishRite Valley of Orange County will have a fantastic 2022!</p>
<p>Our families returned to the Childhood Language Center, Orange County in January after our winter break.  As always we were prepared with updated COVID precautions which allow us to continue providing services for families who need in-person, face to face therapy. For those families who prefer, or need to isolate, we are continuing to provide services on Telehealth when appropriate. After nearly 2 years of limiting new assessments, we are very excited to start evaluating 3 new families a week. This will greatly allow us to expand our outreach to the community and enroll more children at the CLC.  Here are some of the comments that we have received that really fill up the gas tank with excitement and energy to help more families.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Since Covid, we have been on 3 waiting lists for speech and language testing, and we are so grateful you could see our daughter.”<hr>
“We have been so worried Ryder is losing valuable time and he will not be ready for kindergarten. Thank you so much for testing him and starting therapy. We already see improvement after 3 sessions!<hr>
“My husband and I were very worried about taking our 2-year-old son for testing. But the Chapman interns and supervisors were so helpful! They explained all the tests; answered all our questions; engaged our not so cooperative son; and were very thorough. They even were able to get a hearing screening on him! Thank you so much!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all great news and keeps us all coming back for more.</p>

<p>Jamie was so excited to be able to keep “active Augie” sitting at the table. By playing with Play Doh, she was able to expand his vocabulary and give Mom tips on how to help him at home.</p>

<p>Michael, like so many boys his age, navigates technology with ease. Being on Telehealth for him is fun and games and he is learning as well.</p>
