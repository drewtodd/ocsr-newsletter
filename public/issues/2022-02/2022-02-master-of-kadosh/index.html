<p>Greetings brethren,</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know me, my name is <strong>Cristian De Dios</strong>, member of <strong>Anaheim Lodge 207</strong>.</p>
<p>I believe this months news letter is about brotherhood. Well, I just had aquick self-reflective moment where I envisioned myself growing up and playing soccer, basketball, baseball, and Varsity Football. Ive always loved being part of a team of kids or guys coming together for the purpose of helping each other win, get stronger, be more confident, using strategy to overcome obstacles, or just having a cool place to hang out and laugh at each other&rsquo;s oddness. Brotherhood means a lot to me because I&rsquo;ve made many friends, acquaintances, and now new brothers that have helped me develop an understanding for team work, trust, and fidelity. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the way I grew up I don&rsquo;t know if I would&rsquo;ve ever joined Freemasonry or had an Interest in it.</p>

<p>The reason I joined Freemasonry primarily was because of the tenets and the moral lessons you learn along the way. Brotherly love, relief, and truth. My family is widely spread throughout this country or out in Mexico so I never had close family that I can just call to hang out. I was always outside looking to make new friends or just hang out with some. Practicing those skills came in handy along the way. Im the oldest son out of 2 boys my mom had. Mom was always working, I on the other hand was always hanging with the kids on the block. Doing so I learned many lessons along the way.</p>
<p>One of the many lessons was boys will be boys. Making fun of each other, competing with one another, testing each other, backing each other up, and learning about our differences. Little did I know I was practicing the craft without knowing about the fraternity. A brotherhood is so important to a boys development I believe, to help keep you balanced and not thinking that life is a 1 man team. Which is why Im proud of the path I went through to get to this point in life, I was a little Mason going through the degrees in real time as a teen. Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t join De Molay because I didn&rsquo;t know about such program. Many of those experiences helped shape me into the man I am today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve helped brothers who were down, Ive gone to battle to defend our friendship, I&rsquo;ve giving a part of me when I had nothing. I believe that every brother in or out of a Masonic Lodge has an important role or duty to provide to our society. So I hope and pray that each and every one of us finds meaning and purpose to the lessons we have each learned along the way in order to help spread the cement which holds a bond together, for generations of boys and men to come.</p>
<p>Wishing everyone a prosperous and healthy new year!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
