<h1>Venerable Master</h1>

<h1 class="first" id="venerable-master">Venerable Master</h1>
<p>Hello my brothers and welcome to the new year and to the new line of officers for 2022. I am very honored to serve as the Venerable Master for this year and I am proud to be serving with all of the other officers.</p>
<p>This year we switched to a Zoom Officer Installation ceremony with a virtual <strong>Illustrious Frank Loui 33º SGIG</strong> as our Installation Officer. <strong>Illustrious Art Salazar 33º</strong> was virtually flawless as our  Master of Ceremony. <strong>Honorable James Cervantes 32º KCCH</strong> delivered an inspiring prayer to bless everyone in attendance. For me it was a memorable time and I wish to say Thank you to everyone involved.</p>

<p>I recently read this quote while looking for information about brotherly love. The author is unknown but I think the message is perfect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are no strangers in Freemasonry, only friends you’ve yet to meet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the way I feel about coming to lodge. Sometimes our busy schedules might cause us to find excuses for not coming to lodge. Once I am there I really enjoying greeting all the brothers. Spending time with this great group of men makes the effort so worth while. I strongly encourage everyone to make the time this year to attend our lodge and enjoying a little time with your brothers. I look forward to sharing some brotherly love with you soon!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
