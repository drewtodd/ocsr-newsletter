<p>Hello my brothers and welcome to the new year and to the new line of officers for 2022. I am very honored to serve as the Venerable Master for this year and I am proud to be serving with all of the other officers.</p>
<p>This year we switched to a Zoom Officer Installation ceremony with a virtual <strong>Illustrious Frank Loui 33º SGIG</strong> as our Installation Officer. <strong>Illustrious Art Salazar 33º</strong> was virtually flawless as our  Master of Ceremony. <strong>Honorable James Cervantes 32º KCCH</strong> delivered an inspiring prayer to bless everyone in attendance. For me it was a memorable time and I wish to say Thank you to everyone involved.</p>

<p>I recently read this quote while looking for information about brotherly love. The author is unknown but I think the message is perfect.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>There are no strangers in Freemasonry, only friends you’ve yet to meet.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is the way I feel about coming to lodge. Sometimes our busy schedules might cause us to find excuses for not coming to lodge. Once I am there I really enjoying greeting all the brothers. Spending time with this great group of men makes the effort so worth while. I strongly encourage everyone to make the time this year to attend our lodge and enjoying a little time with your brothers. I look forward to sharing some brotherly love with you soon!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Greetings Brethren,</p>
<p>Recently, my high school buddies and I started a podcast. We are all approaching 40 and thought: &ldquo;Hmmm, <em>x</em> person knows football, <em>y</em> person knows litigation, <em>z</em> person knows technology and <em>nth</em> person, name your subject.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll keep the topics light and the characters many, people will follow, maybe a few laughs. I don&rsquo;t know what we were thinking and don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t pedal it on you in this venerable space.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll just say, thank God, we aren&rsquo;t funded by adverts. But, as most exercises do, if you allow them to develop, and evolve, they may demonstrate a new level of knowledge, or at the very least, give us a fresher data set by which we can apply our own rules of thumb on and by extension, achieve a higher level of awareness or some sort of defined level of personal achievement. Rinse and repeat because I&rsquo;ve learned, wins are hard to come by as a daddy of small children. For example, I asked my wife (aka: the great overseer of our home) to criticize the &ldquo;public session&rdquo; and offer protection against the wind. How many of you can guess (without knowing the content I might add) how she responded? This brings me to masonry&hellip;</p>
<p>The Knight of the East, of the Sword, or of the Eagle teaches conviction loyalty / right devotion set against a &lsquo;shattered walls of the city&rsquo; backdrop. This is where I&rsquo;ll add <code>&lt;full stop&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Conviction. Devotion.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing the brethren in person next month. Our virtual installation went smooth, but I am especially excited to hear about your convictions and/or devotion in our upcoming live sessions. I personally believe that conviction times devotion equals authenticity which I categorize as &rsquo;excellence rare&rsquo; when shared especially in Masonry. In fact, its not only our crowning achievement but if boiled down, Masonry being the heir to the ancient wisdom, then by extension and practice, we are the cornerstone or lynchpin or catalyst to our own unique discoveries. In short, sharing is caring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conviction x Devotion = Authenicity</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find it optimal to publish the news that my wife and I are having our third child in early March. I hereby call upon my Senior and Junior Wardens to assist me in my duties as Wise Master, and probable absence as we dedicate our loyalties and rituals to a growing family. Brothers Larry Griffin and David Lockwood will ensure the Chapter is in good hands and give everybody an opportunity for renewal and remembrance.</p>
<p>In our calls to the Almoner, remember Brethren: He who giveth to charity, lendeth to the Lord.</p>
<p>Sincerely &amp; Fraternally,</p>

            <h1 id="master-of-kadosh">Master of Kadosh</h1>
<p>Greetings brethren,</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know me, my name is <strong>Cristian De Dios</strong>, member of <strong>Anaheim Lodge 207</strong>.</p>
<p>I believe this months news letter is about brotherhood. Well, I just had aquick self-reflective moment where I envisioned myself growing up and playing soccer, basketball, baseball, and Varsity Football. Ive always loved being part of a team of kids or guys coming together for the purpose of helping each other win, get stronger, be more confident, using strategy to overcome obstacles, or just having a cool place to hang out and laugh at each other&rsquo;s oddness. Brotherhood means a lot to me because I&rsquo;ve made many friends, acquaintances, and now new brothers that have helped me develop an understanding for team work, trust, and fidelity. If it wasn&rsquo;t for the way I grew up I don&rsquo;t know if I would&rsquo;ve ever joined Freemasonry or had an Interest in it.</p>

        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The reason I joined Freemasonry primarily was because of the tenets and the moral lessons you learn along the way. Brotherly love, relief, and truth. My family is widely spread throughout this country or out in Mexico so I never had close family that I can just call to hang out. I was always outside looking to make new friends or just hang out with some. Practicing those skills came in handy along the way. Im the oldest son out of 2 boys my mom had. Mom was always working, I on the other hand was always hanging with the kids on the block. Doing so I learned many lessons along the way.</p>
<p>One of the many lessons was boys will be boys. Making fun of each other, competing with one another, testing each other, backing each other up, and learning about our differences. Little did I know I was practicing the craft without knowing about the fraternity. A brotherhood is so important to a boys development I believe, to help keep you balanced and not thinking that life is a 1 man team. Which is why Im proud of the path I went through to get to this point in life, I was a little Mason going through the degrees in real time as a teen. Unfortunately I didn&rsquo;t join De Molay because I didn&rsquo;t know about such program. Many of those experiences helped shape me into the man I am today.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve helped brothers who were down, Ive gone to battle to defend our friendship, I&rsquo;ve giving a part of me when I had nothing. I believe that every brother in or out of a Masonic Lodge has an important role or duty to provide to our society. So I hope and pray that each and every one of us finds meaning and purpose to the lessons we have each learned along the way in order to help spread the cement which holds a bond together, for generations of boys and men to come.</p>
<p>Wishing everyone a prosperous and healthy new year!</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>

<h2 id="brotherly-love">Brotherly Love</h2>
<p>Happy February, brothers; the month of love, as it were. With Valentines Day sitting squarely in the middle of the year’s shortest month, it’s worth knowing that February 14th was chosen as St. Valentine’s Day — or the Feast of St. Valentine — not for any rosy associations, but because that was the date that the Catholic priest Valentine was set to be executed by Emperor Claudius II.</p>
<p>His crime? Performing the secret marriage ceremonies of young lovers.</p>
<figure class="right large border shadow"><img src="./img/st-valentine.jpg"
         alt="St. Valentine"/><figcaption>
            <p>Saint Valentine</p>
        </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Apparently, Claudius thought a married soldier — a family man — was a liability on the battlefield, and thus outlawed the marriage of young men. When he discovered that Valentine was performing clandestine ceremonies of holy matrimony, Claudius did not take it well. Valentine paid for his crimes with his head.</p>
<p>At least that’s one version of the story.</p>
<p>And that brings me to our theme for February: Brotherly love.  This is the stuff of the fraternity; the foundation upon which all other masonic ideals — temperance, fortitude, justice, truth, liberty, equality and fraternity — are built. And it’s worth reminding ourselves of the principles of brotherly love during these times when we see such divisiveness and mistrust in the world and our communities.</p>
<p>As Masons, we may not walk around displaying overt acts of brotherly love, but we should keep love in our hearts when dealing with a brother — with anyone, really. Remember that this person comes from the same stuff as yourself. They may have differences, but we all share the stuff of humanity.</p>
<p>I encourage all of us to slow down; take a moment. Appreciate your brothers for their commitment to the craft and the bonds that we share as Masons. But also appreciate the differences we have. And remember that it’s okay — good, really — to have them.</p>
<p>We live in remarkable times and as humans have done incredible things, but to borrow a quote from Martin Luther King, Jr.:</p>
<p><figure class="right medium border shadow"><img src="./img/mlk.jpg"
         alt="The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr."/>

<br></p>
<blockquote>
<p>“We have flown the air like birds and swum the sea like fishes, but have yet to learn the simple act of walking the earth like brothers.” <br> <strong>- The Reverend Martin Luther King, Jr.</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p><br>As is our creed, let’s try to be better men and reflect on what it is to love your brother.</p>
<p>I’d also like to take this opportunity to thank <strong>Ill. Frankie Rosario</strong>, <strong>Hon. David Frias,</strong> and all of our Heads of Body for the opportunity to serve as Senior Warden this year. I look forward to a productive and enlightening experience.</p>

<p>Welcome back to the RiteCare Language Center of Orange County!  We are very thankful for the new year and all the opportunity it brings to our children and families.  We hope our friends at the ScottishRite Valley of Orange County will have a fantastic 2022!</p>
<p>Our families returned to the Childhood Language Center, Orange County in January after our winter break.  As always we were prepared with updated COVID precautions which allow us to continue providing services for families who need in-person, face to face therapy. For those families who prefer, or need to isolate, we are continuing to provide services on Telehealth when appropriate. After nearly 2 years of limiting new assessments, we are very excited to start evaluating 3 new families a week. This will greatly allow us to expand our outreach to the community and enroll more children at the CLC.  Here are some of the comments that we have received that really fill up the gas tank with excitement and energy to help more families.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Since Covid, we have been on 3 waiting lists for speech and language testing, and we are so grateful you could see our daughter.”<hr>
“We have been so worried Ryder is losing valuable time and he will not be ready for kindergarten. Thank you so much for testing him and starting therapy. We already see improvement after 3 sessions!<hr>
“My husband and I were very worried about taking our 2-year-old son for testing. But the Chapman interns and supervisors were so helpful! They explained all the tests; answered all our questions; engaged our not so cooperative son; and were very thorough. They even were able to get a hearing screening on him! Thank you so much!”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is all great news and keeps us all coming back for more.</p>

<p>Jamie was so excited to be able to keep “active Augie” sitting at the table. By playing with Play Doh, she was able to expand his vocabulary and give Mom tips on how to help him at home.</p>
<figure class="right medium border rotate-counter shadow"><img src="img/Michael.jpeg"/>

<p>Michael, like so many boys his age, navigates technology with ease. Being on Telehealth for him is fun and games and he is learning as well.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;d like to participate or are looking for information about the program, please prepare by <a href="https://scottishrite.org/scottish-rite-master-craftsman-program/">visiting the official website</a> for information about the books and other information to get you started:</p>
<h2 id="the-master-craftsman-program">The Master Craftsman Program</h2>
<p>For those unaware, the Scottish Rite Master Craftsman (SRMC) program is an exciting, correspondence course designed and administered by staff at the House of the Temple in Washington, DC, under the guidance and leadership of the Supreme Council, 33°, of the A&amp;A Scottish Rite, Southern Jurisdiction, USA. All three courses are available as mail-in courses or online.</p>
<p>Starting in February, we will begin covering the quizzes from both the Symbolic Logic and the Scottish Rite History and Ritual programs, alternating each month. This will allow you to get through both programs in a timely fashion, and help ensure that all bases are covered.</p>
