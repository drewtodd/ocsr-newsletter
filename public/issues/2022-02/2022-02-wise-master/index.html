<h1>Wise Master</h1>

<h1 id="wise-master">Wise Master</h1>
<p>Greetings Brethren,</p>
<p>Recently, my high school buddies and I started a podcast. We are all approaching 40 and thought: &ldquo;Hmmm, <em>x</em> person knows football, <em>y</em> person knows litigation, <em>z</em> person knows technology and <em>nth</em> person, name your subject.&rdquo; We&rsquo;ll keep the topics light and the characters many, people will follow, maybe a few laughs. I don&rsquo;t know what we were thinking and don&rsquo;t worry, I won&rsquo;t pedal it on you in this venerable space.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ll just say, thank God, we aren&rsquo;t funded by adverts. But, as most exercises do, if you allow them to develop, and evolve, they may demonstrate a new level of knowledge, or at the very least, give us a fresher data set by which we can apply our own rules of thumb on and by extension, achieve a higher level of awareness or some sort of defined level of personal achievement. Rinse and repeat because I&rsquo;ve learned, wins are hard to come by as a daddy of small children. For example, I asked my wife (aka: the great overseer of our home) to criticize the &ldquo;public session&rdquo; and offer protection against the wind. How many of you can guess (without knowing the content I might add) how she responded? This brings me to masonry&hellip;</p>
<p>The Knight of the East, of the Sword, or of the Eagle teaches conviction loyalty / right devotion set against a &lsquo;shattered walls of the city&rsquo; backdrop. This is where I&rsquo;ll add <code>&lt;full stop&gt;</code>.</p>
<p>Conviction. Devotion.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing the brethren in person next month. Our virtual installation went smooth, but I am especially excited to hear about your convictions and/or devotion in our upcoming live sessions. I personally believe that conviction times devotion equals authenticity which I categorize as &rsquo;excellence rare&rsquo; when shared especially in Masonry. In fact, its not only our crowning achievement but if boiled down, Masonry being the heir to the ancient wisdom, then by extension and practice, we are the cornerstone or lynchpin or catalyst to our own unique discoveries. In short, sharing is caring.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Conviction x Devotion = Authenicity</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I find it optimal to publish the news that my wife and I are having our third child in early March. I hereby call upon my Senior and Junior Wardens to assist me in my duties as Wise Master, and probable absence as we dedicate our loyalties and rituals to a growing family. Brothers Larry Griffin and David Lockwood will ensure the Chapter is in good hands and give everybody an opportunity for renewal and remembrance.</p>
<p>In our calls to the Almoner, remember Brethren: He who giveth to charity, lendeth to the Lord.</p>
<p>Sincerely &amp; Fraternally,</p>
