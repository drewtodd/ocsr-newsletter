<h1>Senior Warden, Orange County Lodge of Perfection</h1>

<h1 id="senior-warden">Senior Warden</h1>
<p>Have you made your New Years Resolutions?  I don’t usually make a list for myself but I feel like I need to make some changes so the first change is to make a list.   Obviously the idea is to make a list of goals that will help to make me a better person, husband, father, friend, brother during this year.  Basically the last two years were bad and I don’t want to keep treading water.  We only have so much time so I want to get the most bang for my buck.</p>
<p>January is just a great time to start something new.  We are start a new year so that is a good enough reason to make yourself a little newer.  If you search the internet you can find a bunch of examples that can help you get started.  Let me know if you plan on making your own list!</p>
<p>Here is my list in no specific order:</p>
<p><strong>Be Early</strong> - Instead of procrastinating on everything try and get things done early.  For example get my article written early instead of always turning it in late.</p>
<p><strong>Be Present</strong> - Try to focus more on the people I’m with instead of always being distracted.  It is too easy to look at my dam phone instead of trying to have a good conversation.</p>
<p><strong>Exercise More</strong> - This past year I did better about getting some exercise. This new year I need to be more regular about moving my body so I can stay healthy.</p>
<p><strong>Learn something New</strong> - It would be great to learn a second language.  I’ve dabbled with learning Spanish almost my whole life.  I need to get beyond the basic survival skills of ordering a beer and asking for the bathroom.</p>
<p><strong>Learn to play golf</strong> - This one is for my wife.  She retired this year and is eagerly learning to play golf.  This would be something fun for us to do together.</p>
<p><strong>Eat more Leafy vegetables</strong> -  Another one my wife would like but basically less bacon and more green veggies.</p>
<p>So I am very honored to be the new Venerable Master for our Valley in 2022.  Thank you for your support and I will do my best to make you proud of your selection.  Please join us on January 16th at 2:00pm for the installation ceremony  at the Demolay Center and RSVP to the office so they know you are attending.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
