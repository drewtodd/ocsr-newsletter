<h1>Venerable Master, Lodge of Perfection</h1>

<h1 id="venerable-master">Venerable Master</h1>
<p>Greetings Brethren, I would like to take this moment to wish you a happy and prosperous New Year’s. May GOD Bless you and your family with many cherished memories, during this New Year’s that may last for generations to come.</p>
<p>It has been an Honor and privilege to serve our Orange County Valley Scottish Rite this year, as Venerable Master. This year did not start out like I imagined, with us still having to deal with the COVID restrictions. Which continued to limit us from gathering in person for most of the year. We did the best we could with the cards dealt us, until we were able to start our meeting in person later this year.</p>
<p>Our monthly zoom call, helped to keep us connected, they were well attended and productive. We had a very special call in June with our Sovereign Grand Commander Ill. James Cole, 33°, along with Grand Master of Masons in California, Most Worshipful Brother Arthur H. Weiss, and our Sovereign Grand Inspector General, Southern Jurisdiction, Orient of California, Ill. Frank Loui, 33°</p>
<p>We held a couple of See’s candy fundraiser for the benefit of the Valley where we raised $631.00.</p>
<p>We also held a joint reunion class with the support from our surrounding Scottish Rite Valleys, which was held at the Long Beach Scottish Rite Center. It was great to see the cooperation between our valleys, and how well everyone worked together to perform some quality degrees, for the benefit of the new class members.</p>
<p>Not wanting to be partial, but I was extremely proud of the degree work performed by our Orange County Valley degrees teams. They truly shined, thank you for the hard work and dedication to our valley.</p>
<p>In parting I would like to congratulate our newly elected Venerable Master, Honorable David Frias along with the elected and appointed officers for 2022. I know you will do an amazing job leading our Orange County Scottish Rite Valley, along with supporting our Language Center in 2022.</p>
<p>Sincerely and fraternally,</p>
