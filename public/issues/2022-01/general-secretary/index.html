<h1>General Secretary</h1>

<h1 id="general-secretary">General Secretary</h1>
<p>Brethren: A very Happy New Year to all of the Brothers of the Orange County Valley. January is a busy month. We will be having our Stated Meeting on Monday, January 3rd at 6:30 pm at the DeMolay Center. Our Installation Ceremony for 2022 officers will be held at the Demolay Center on Sunday afternoon, January 16th. An email will be coming out with more information. Installation is one of the best ceremonies in the Scottish Rite. Please plan on attending and staying for the good meal afterwards. On Dec. 3rd, OCSR hosted the annual Personal Representative &amp; General Secretary&rsquo;s Meeting with our SGIG. All 20 Valleys in the Orient of California attended this meeting followed by a meal. We thank Illustrious Frankie Rosario 33°, Hon. David Frias 32° KCCH and Hon. James Cervantes 32° KCCH for their work on this successful event.</p>
<p>The Valley office has been busy with 2022 dues payments. We thank the Brethren for their prompt dues payments. These dues payments provide the funds to pay and maintain all Valley expenses (Valley office, DeMolay rental, insurance etc.). If you have any question about your dues status, please reach out to me at the email or phone number below. Have an outstanding 2022!</p>
