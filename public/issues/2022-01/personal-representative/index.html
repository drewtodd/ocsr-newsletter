<h1>Personal Representative of the Sovereign Grand Inspector General in California Orange County Scottish Rite Valley</h1>

<h1 class="first" id="personal-representative">Personal Representative</h1>
<p>Dear Brethren: On behalf of the Orange County Scottish Rite Valley, it is my pleasure to welcome you to a New Year, hoping that 2022 brings the promise for a return to a more normal program and along with that, the chance to partake on all the activities scheduled for this year.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I would like to begin by recognizing and thanking our 2021 officers for giving their time to our Valley and our fraternity, starting with <strong>Hon. Mike Selix, 32° KCCH</strong> who served as our Venerable Master in the lodge of Perfection, <strong>Bro. Anthony Arismendi, 32°</strong> who served as Wise Master in the Chapter of Rose Croix, <strong>Bro. Diego Verduzco, 32°</strong> who served as Commander in the Council of Kadosh and <strong>Bro. Stephen Carney, 32°</strong>  who served as Master of Kadosh in the Consistory. Please accept our sincere gratitude for your efforts and for helping our Valley navigate what turned out to be a challenging time. I encourage every member to please make the time to personally reach out and thank each of our 2021 officers for their dedication and steady support.</p>
<p>In 2022, we welcome a new line of leaders who are eager to make a significant impact in our Valley. First, congratulations to <strong>Hon. Bro. David Frias, 32° KCCH</strong>, for being elected as our Venerable Master. I am certain Bro. Frias will do a magnificent job in leading our Valley this year. Also, welcomes to <strong>Bro. Brandon Cook, 32°</strong>, for being elected as Wise Master, <strong>Bro. Alex Gonzalez White, 32°</strong>, for being elected as Commander and <strong>Bro. Cristian DeDios, 32°</strong>, for being elected as Master of Kadosh. I also would like to congratulate and recognize every brother who has been elected and appointed to serve our Valley in each imperative role. With that said, to all Elected and Appointed brothers, we look forward to your respectable work and continuing dedication to our Valley and our craft. We all appreciate your enthusiasm and continuing support.</p>
<p>I am excited to share with you that in 2022, we will continue our commitment to provide every brother joining our Valley during the year, an automatic enrollment in the Master Craftsman program as soon as they receive their 32° degree. Allowing every new Scottish Rite member to participate in our Masonic education program provides further light in Masonry. With education being a very important part of our future, <strong>Bro. Andrew Todd, 32°</strong>, as the Director of the Masonic Education Program along with <strong>Hon. Bro. James Cervantes</strong> and <strong>Hon. Bro. James McCallion</strong>, we will revamp our program and provide a better experience to all brothers attending this essential part of our growth in our masonic life.</p>
<p>We are also thrilled to announce that we have our Class Reunion team complete. With Hon. Bro. James Cervantes serving as Director of Work, Bro. James McCallion serving as Director of Classroom and Bro. Matthew Gage serving as Director of Ritual, we are in for a breathtaking threat and a much-improved experience. I cannot wait to witness their labor of love during our next Reunion Class, as I am certain it will be a great experience for everyone.</p>
<p>I would like to also thank Hon. Bro. David Frias, 32° KCCH for serving our Valley as Director and Bro. Todd Herschberg, for serving as Member in the Board of Directors of the California Scottish Rite Foundation and in doing so, representing our Valley and our RiteCare Childhood Language Center of Orange County. We Sincerely appreciate their dedication to our foundation and guardianship of our Language Center.</p>
<p>As we continue to work towards a brighter future, I encourage you to get involved and help us improve our Valley for the benefit of our brotherhood. If you are interested in being part of this exciting effort, please contact Ill. Bro. Ralph Shelton, 33° Assistant to the Personal Representative, Administration, or myself. I know you will have a great time helping make our Strategic Initiatives successful.</p>
<p>For those of you who are active in Blue Lodges, please continue to actively promote the Orange County Scottish Rite every time you visit your Lodge. Keep working with non-Scottish Rite Masons by presenting petitions, especially knowing that our Masonic Education program has proven to be successful. We all know new membership continues to be a challenge for many Valleys, but if we make the effort to speak to our Blue Lodges, I am certain that we will make a significant difference in our membership.</p>
<p>Please encourage our Mason brother to download an application by visiting our main site, <a href="https://www.ocscottishrite.org/">www.OCScottishRite.org</a>, and from the “Membership” menu, choose “Application for Degrees”. Have them fill out the application and either mail or email it to our office along with the initiation fee. Just as last year, our goal is to have at least 6 new brothers for each Reunion class. With your help we can do this!</p>
<p>As your Personal Representative, it is my commitment to work hard in reinvigorating our fraternity, so we can increase our membership and our fellowship, all critical to our sustainability and success for many more years to come.</p>
<p>If you have any questions for me, please don’t hesitate to email or call. My cell number is <a href="tel:17146006194">714-600-6914</a>, and my email is <a href="mailto:frosario@OCScottishRite.org">frosario@OCScottishRite.org</a>.
I look forward to working with you and making a greater difference in 2022!</p>
<p>Fraternally yours,</p>
